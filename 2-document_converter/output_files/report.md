Globalisation is gradually creeping into every nook and corner of the world, but the ghost of brain drain still continues to haunt India as talented young students continue to go abroad every year for education, as well as for employment opportunities. UNESCO report in 1969, defined brain drain as " an abnormal form of scientific exchange between countries, characterized by a one-way flow in favour of the most highly developed countries".

These are the same students who got trained in India, Pakistan or China and have now moved abroad for better opportunities.
