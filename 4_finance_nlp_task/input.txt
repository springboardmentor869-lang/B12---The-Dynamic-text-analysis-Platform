Building enterprises in the age of AI
Over the past two years, we’ve seen rapid growth in AI 
awareness, usage, and investment. The hunger to learn fast 
and experiment faster has been insatiable. With growing 
ease of use and increasing access to AI assistants, co-pilots 
and tools, AI use-cases and pilots have mushroomed and 
burgeoned across the enterprise, with some value realized. 
The unbridled enthusiasm around AI has meant that CXOs 
are no longer having to advocate for the value of AI within 
the enterprise. Instead, they can invest now in scaling, 
driving adoption and governing.
The distinct opportunity is to build with AI to amplify the 
potential of employees, and modernize systems and how 
they empower people working within the organization, 
to increase efficiency, productivity, and innovation. This in 
turn can transform the value these businesses can bring 
to their customers. By strategically implementing AI and 
ensuring it complements human capabilities, businesses 
can significantly improve customer proposition and 
service, leading to increased satisfaction, loyalty, and 
ultimately, better business outcomes.
This endeavor can be multi-tiered and complex. AI 
experiments are often heterogeneous, requiring diverse 
data and tech stacks that necessitate building entire new 
architectural foundations before value can be realized. 
There is also the need to focus on making sure that AI

systems are used fairly and responsibly so that they can 
truly serve the enterprise at scale.
Applying AI at a scale that can power the entire 
enterprise involves building AI capabilities mindfully. This 
entails nurturing a robust data strategy, investing in AI 
infrastructure optimization, while also systemically building 
capacity to deepen algorithmic efficiencies and improve 
model performance. In many ways, this is about reframing 
the status quo for an AI-first future – with sustained value 
in mind. Leaders embrace a hybrid approach to power their 
AI flywheels. They need flexibility of infrastructure – both 
rental and owned models – to bring them the control that 
they need over the environment, along with the potential 
to drive efficiencies in the long run, in addition to security 
and compliance efficiencies as well. 
We are building templates for AI success – industry after 
industry, business after business – for enterprise-scale 
value generation for our clients. We are helping them 
AI their enterprise in ways that are changing the game 
for them today and giving them a head start into the 
future. Some interesting examples, as case studies, make 
for interesting and quick reading later in this Integrated 
Annual Report. In many ways, it’s exactly what you’d expect 
from a partner whose promise to enterprises is – navigate 
your next.
Americana Restaurants is the largest out-of-home 
dining and quick-service restaurant operator in their 12 
countries of operation across the Middle East and North 
Africa. With strong franchisor partnerships and a diverse 
portfolio of iconic global brands, including KFC, Pizza 
Hut, Hardee’s, Krispy Kreme, Peet’s Coffee, Wimpy, TGI 
Friday’s, Costa Coffee, and Baskin Robbins, the company 
delivers world-class dining experiences. Their growth, 
in recent years, has been so rapid that it was starting 
to strain their technology infrastructure, exposing 
limitations in their ability to scale to demand. They 
sought out Infosys’ expertise to help them establish 
a state-of-the-art BPM framework that would bring 
transparency and efficiency into their process ecosystem 
while prioritizing their vital enterprise Accounts Payable 
processes for AI-powered transformation. 
Infosys started at the foundation, completely 
reimagining Americana Restaurants’ document-centric 
workflows for an enterprise set to turn AI-first. The 
deployment of Infosys Accounts Payable Solution on 
the cloud and its application enterprise-wide ensured 
that Americana Restaurants significantly improved 
efficiency, reducing processing times, minimizing 
errors, and optimizing costs. The integration of agentic 
AI that followed has made their invoice processing 
largely autonomous. AI agents process invoices end-
to-end and offer support for multiple languages while 
managing complex validations and diverse expense 
types and processing exceptions with minimal human 
intervention. When required, users enjoy a highly 
intuitive user interface that only requires them to access 
a very simple training that serves them well across 
devices, from desktops to mobiles.
Infosys’ agentic AI-powered cloud-based Accounts 
Payable solution is among the first of its kind anywhere 
in the world that empowers Americana Restaurants to:
•	
Not only process invoices with minimal human 
intervention but predict and plan for future 
transactions
•	
Adapt the accounts payable environment 
dynamically to process deviations, reduce errors, 
and increase accuracy
•	
Leverage Microsoft Azure GPT-4 Omni for 
continuous learning and operational improvements
“Our partnership with Infosys has helped us embrace enterprise AI and transform 
the way we manage finance operations. With AI, our invoice processing is faster, 
more accurate, and far more future-proofed. This leap forward has also meant 
bringing more intelligence into our Accounts Payable, and we are looking to apply 
that learning into other areas of our organization.”

integrated ICT solutions for connectivity, security and 
IoT advancing their digitalization.
The company’s IT strategy is built around customer-
centric innovation, operational excellence, infrastructure

key technologies supporting the digital transformation 
is AI, with one of its building blocks being a unified 
data platform which aggregates data from various 
sources (customer interactions, network performance, 
billing, etc.) and has already been implemented by 
Sunrise. Additional building blocks that are being 
worked on are AI/ML models to generate actionable 
insights for personalized customer experiences, 
predictive maintenance, and fraud detection as well as 
comprehensive self-service options tailored to digitally 
savvy customers. The goal is to drive customer retention 
and loyalty in addition to enabling targeted marketing

the full Microsoft M365 suite, Sunrise is nurturing a 
fully modern, AI-driven, cloud-based collaborative 
workplace, in collaboration with Infosys.

Posti is a versatile, modern, and international logistics 
company with nearly 400 years of experience. Today, 
the company connects people and companies with 
postal services, parcels, e-commerce, and freight 
services, in addition to warehouse and logistics across 
the Nordic and Baltic countries. Posti was early to 
embrace the power of enterprise AI to accelerate the 
transformation of its IT landscape and amplify its ability 
to deliver exceptional services, optimize operations, and 
strengthen its position as a leading delivery and logistics 
provider. 
In partnership with Infosys, Posti was quick to create an 
AI-powered efficient and customer centric organization 
with:
•	
Enhanced operational efficiency and observability: 
By implementing Infosys’ Live Enterprise Application 
Management Platform with embedded generative 
AI capabilities, Posti has fully transformed its 
business process monitoring. The Platform 
addresses visibility gaps, enabling automated 
monitoring and AI-based incident triaging. By 
correlating insights from the Infosys platform with 
its other platforms, Posti has a comprehensive 
and unified view of its entire IT landscape. This has 
dramatically reduced critical process downtime for 
the company by over 90%, and helped it shift from 
reactive to predictive incident management.
•	
Proactive IT operations management: Posti 
leverages GitHub Copilot to accelerate legacy code 
comprehension and improve its application lifecycle 
management. Furthermore, the deployment of 
Nanoheal, a self-help/self-heal tool, along with a 
generative AI-powered chatbot, drives proactive 
resolution of IT incidents across the company. These 
innovations have also resulted in reduced support 
call volumes for the organization along with dips of 
almost 40% in Mean Time to Resolution.
•	
Accelerated application development: GitHub 
Copilot has significantly increased the pace of Posti’s 
software development lifecycle. The capability 
has boosted the company’s application lifecycle 
productivity by approximately 35%, accelerating 
both application development and deployment. 
This enables Posti to bring new and enhanced 
services to market faster, strengthening its 
competitive edge in a fast-changing marketplace.
“As we navigate the next phase of our evolution with enterprise AI, 
with Infosys, Posti will not only become a leader in the logistics and 
e-commerce sector, but a true digital frontrunner in the Nordics.”

but ensures that all decisions regarding our engineering work are made by 
capable human staff. Enterprise AI is a robust enabler that we use to provide 
additional benefits and cost efficiencies for our clients. We are leveraging 
Infosys’ services and pioneering research in AI to help us achieve these goals.”

Chairman’s message
Performance overview
As we contemplate the developments of the last few 
months, we know we are in an era of uncertainty that 
we have never seen before. Multiple trends are colliding 
and leading us to reexamine the fundamentals of our 
businesses. 
As geopolitics becomes front and centre in our lives, we are 
having to take cognizance of the world not as one single 
global market but as fragmented blocs and countries. 
This means making strategic choices and even navigating 
between these blocs. COVID brought into focus the critical 
and pressing need to derisk our supply chain and build 
viable alternatives. It was no longer enough to deliver 
just-in-time; we had to also factor in for just-in-case. Now 
tariffs are further driving home the point that we need to 
diversify our sourcing. Tariffs will be differentiated across 
products and countries and will likely keep changing. 
Bilateral and regional rules of trade will dominate. Supply 
chains will continue to shift as tariffs become another form 
of arbitrage. 
The advent of AI with all its possibilities and potential 
creates another arc of uncertainty. As enterprises look 
at applying AI to every aspect of the business, some 
longstanding challenges will become imperative and 
self-evident to firms. For example, the need to modernize 
legacy systems, and the need to create data architecture 
so that all the firm’s data is consumable by AI, in a holistic 
manner, can no longer be put off. Firms will need to have 
an AI foundry for rapid innovation and an AI factory to 
scale successful innovations across the enterprise. While 
embracing AI will bring a goldmine of opportunities, it will 
not be entirely without some foreseeable risks. Regulatory 
variances across regions will need to be incorporated 
into one’s strategy. The early learnings from enterprise AI 
adoption gives us a glimpse of these potential challenges 
that lie on the path ahead.
Climate change and the associated energy transition adds 
to the crucible of uncertainties. So much of the future 
depends on innovation and the form of energy that will 
fuel us forward – solar, wind, batteries, pumped hydro, 
green hydrogen, nuclear, carbon capture and storage, etc. 
Global climate deals will set the pace of change. The only 
thing certain is that electricity will play a much bigger 
role in the days ahead. And the pace of its rollout will be 
contingent on building new transmission lines, setting up 
charging stations, and acquiring more transformers. This 
transformation will naturally be constrained by regulatory 
cholesterol. The price of various commodities will rise, 
An era of uncertainty
and fall based on the speed of transition. And many assets 
could well be stranded.
Every business vertical is facing challenges of various kinds. 
Car makers are dealing with the transition from ICE engines 
to batteries. Pharma companies are looking at accelerating 
the pace of drug discovery with AI. Logistics companies 
are dealing with the complete reordering of global supply 
chains. Financial service companies are considering 
the tokenization of their assets. Energy companies are 
assessing the long-term demand for their products. Utilities 
are facing a distributed future. Manufacturing companies 
are navigating the advent of robots and 3D printing. 
Service companies are dealing with AI agents performing 
their tasks. There is not a sector that remains unscathed 
as rapid business and technological disruption forces 
businesses to adapt and advance.
Amid these growing uncertainties, there is a certainty that 
Infosys brings, that is of immense value to enterprises. 
The Infosys basket of products and services is diversified 
across geographies, verticals and technologies with 
solutions to both traditional and emerging business 
challenges. These solutions are created to support clients’ 
investments in growth as well as for when they are cutting 
back on costs. Infosys is differentiated by its continuous 
and active investments in nurturing an engaged and 
committed workforce. A big part of this investment is in 
creating flexible training and skilling capability so that 
this workforce is always abreast of changing technology 
and business practices. There is also a relentless focus on 
productivity, so business investments work harder. Even 
as Infosys strives to be a truly AI-first company, there is a 
simultaneous and equal focus on being at the forefront of 
sustainability. In every way, we seek to continue to rank 
among the world’s most respected companies.
We’ve always believed in enthusiastically embracing 
change. After all, our brand’s promise to our stakeholders 
is to help them navigate their next. We also have immense 
confidence stemming from our fortress balance sheet – 
characterized by high liquidity, zero debt, and the ability 
to withstand uncertainty. Above all, at Infosys, we remain 
fully aligned on strategy, yet tactically agile, having high 
mutual trust and responsiveness to customers, investors 
and employee needs. 
So many things have changed. Then again, some things 
remain unchanged.

Letter to the Shareholder
Performance overview
Dear shareholder,
Financial year 2025 was another year of strong execution 
for Infosys. We had growth of 4.2%, operating margin of 
21.1%, and free cash flow of US$4.1 billion. We announced 
a total dividend of `43 per share (including an interim 
dividend of `21 per share).
Infosys is the leader in AI, cloud, data, and digital for our 
clients.
Infosys Topaz brings the power of AI, with a strong 
foundation of cloud and data, to help our clients leverage 
the next generation of opportunities. To help our clients 
with AI, we have built a repository of AI agents. These 
agents improve productivity in areas such as code 
generation, IT operations, bill-to-cash, and quote-to-order. 
We have developed domain-specific language models 
for some industries, IT operations, and cybersecurity. As a 
result of our expertise and strong partnership with industry 
leaders, we are now offering model development as a 
service to our customers.
Our Cobalt cloud capabilities provide the foundation for 
AI. We are working with the leading public cloud providers, 
private cloud players, SaaS companies, and PaaS platforms.
Data is another foundational element for AI. Our 
capabilities in data architecture and managing structured 
and unstructured data give our clients confidence to use 
their data for enterprise AI deployment.
Our expertise across enterprise solutions, engineering 
services, cybersecurity, applications, infrastructure, and 
operations continues to drive value creation for our clients.
We have continued our focus on cost efficiency, 
automation, lean, and delivering productivity 
improvements for our clients.
With our deep expertise across AI, cloud, data, digital, and 
cost efficiency offerings, we are well-established as the 
preferred partner for large enterprises across the world.
During the year, Infosys was recognized as a top 100 most 
valuable brand in the world and ranked among the most 
trusted brands in the US, by Kantar BrandZ. For the fifth 
consecutive year, we were recognized as one of the World’s 
Most Ethical Companies.
We recruited over 15,000 college graduates in the year and 
ended the year with over 3,20,000 employees. 39% of our 
workforce are women employees.
The Infosys Foundation continues to create positive impact 
by supporting the communities we work with, in the areas 
of healthcare, education, women empowerment, and 
sustainability. Over the year, the Foundation impacted 
over 1 crore lives through its outreach programs. Infosys 
Springboard, our free skilling platform, is helping build 
digital skills globally and has already provided free learning 
programs to 9.2 million people around the world.
Our client relationships have been the foundation of 
success through the years. We thank our clients for their 
continued trust and partnership.
We value the enormous contribution of our over 3,20,000 
employees for making our clients successful. Their 
dedication and continued pursuit of excellence have 
enabled sustained value creation for our clients.
Thanks to our Board for their guidance and support for our 
strategic direction.
As technology continues to be more central in the world, 
Infosys becomes more relevant to our clients.
I remain optimistic about the enormous opportunities we 
have for the future.
With my warmest regards,
Sd/-

Our business context
Approaching value creation
Technology continues to transform 
businesses in every industry 
around the world in a profound 
and fundamental way. In fiscal 
2025, AI, including agentic AI, 
generative AI, 5G, Low Code No 
Code and quantum computing 
shaped the future of industries. 
From new AI architectures like 
small language models and multi-
agents to precision manufacturing, 
this year, we are tackling some 
of the hardest challenges across 
industries by building strong 
data foundations with robust 
cloud capabilities. Responsible 
business approaches, including 
embracing Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG), continue 
to gain traction. We continued to 
witness businesses attempting to 
reimagine their cost structures, 
increase business resilience and 
agility, personalize experiences 
for customers and employees, 
and launch new and disruptive 
products and services. Enterprises are 
leveraging AI to extend the value of 
existing investments and, in parallel, 
transform and future-proof their 
business. The need for professionals 
who are highly skilled in both 
traditional and digital technology 
areas is driving businesses to 
build strategic technology and 
IT partnerships to realize their 
transformation journeys.
We see AI across industries fine-
tune the necessities of specialized 
domains and tasks. Firms globally are 
racing to support AI agents and we 
are on the path to enabling them. 
Agents are expected to drive the next 
wave of monetization of AI. Central 
to this shift of AI agents is the agenda 
to build intelligent systems that are 
capable of doing tasks with multiple 
steps, autonomous interactions 
with tools and data and automating 
business workflows.
The future of the technology industry 
continues to be shaped by the 
following trends:
•	 Focus on enterprise AI capabilities
•	 Demand for IT services with 
growth pockets emerging in areas 
like cloud, cybersecurity, IoT and 
immersive technologies.
•	 Focus on cost takeouts to 
deal with the uncertain global 
environment.
•	 Increase in enterprise spending 
on hybrid, multi-cloud / AI-led 
transformation.
•	 Intense competition for talent as 
enterprises embrace new ways 
of working amid scarcity of niche 
digital skills.
•	 Continued focus on ESG as a 
strategic theme for all enterprise 
stakeholders.
Intense competition marks the 
delivery of traditional services in 
a rapidly changing marketplace, 
especially with the emergence of 
new players in niche technology 
areas. Infosys’ industry expertise, 
end‑to-end service capability and 
digital solutions, ability to scale, 
established platforms, superior 
quality and process execution, 
distributed agile global delivery 
model, experienced management 
team, talented professionals and 
track record are often cited as clear 
differentiators.

Our business context
Core
Strategy
Approaching value creation
We are seeing growing demand from 
clients to partner with them as they 
prepare their enterprises for success 
in the AI era, where they are moving 
from a use-case-based approach to 
an agentic AI-led transformational 
approach.
We have successfully delivered 
over 400 generative AI projects 
by bringing Infosys Topaz, our 
generative and agentic AI-powered 
services and solutions. Our AI work 
spans a wide spectrum of priority 
areas like process improvement, 
engineering, customer service, 
cybersecurity, and employee 
productivity. We have built four 
small language models for banking, 
IT operations, cyber and enterprises 
broadly.
Energize the core
In fiscal 2025, we won a total contract 
value of over US$11.6 billion in large 
deals, continuing to demonstrate our 
capabilities and competitiveness in 
executing complex transformations. 
Our capabilities support our clients 
in their growth areas related to AI, 
cloud, and digital and their efficiency 
areas related to automation, cost 
reduction, and consolidation. While 
we witness a strong deal momentum, 
we have also enhanced our GCC 
capabilities across consult, sell, build 
and deliver.
Reskill our people
Continuous learning and reskilling 
have always been integral to our 
operating model. We operate our 
reskilling program with the twin 
objectives of fulfilling demand 
for digital skills in client projects 
and enriching the expertise of our 
global workforce in next-generation 
technologies and methodologies. 
We invested in and scaled our digital 
reskilling program globally to include 
the latest generative AI courses. Over 
2,70,000 of our employees today 
are AI-aware. Our platforms are also 
enhanced with generative AI aspects.
Expand localization
Aiming to create differentiated talent 
pools and ecosystems in our markets, 
we made significant investments in 
expanding our local workforce in the 
US, UK, Europe, Japan, China, Canada 
and Australia.
Looking ahead, and to continue 
staying relevant to the emerging 
needs of our clients, we prioritize:
•	 Our journey of being AI-first and 
our customers’ navigation to AI;
•	 Agentic AI is now at the forefront 
of most of our client conversations, 
and we are seeing a strong 
business case to drive efficiency 
and improve customer experience. 
Through our Infosys Agentic 
Foundry, we have developed 
hundreds of agents across various 
industries. Multiple agentic 
projects went live, showing strong 
Returns on Investments in terms of 
cost as well as business benefits.
•	 Continuing to scale our cloud 
capabilities, especially in cloud 
advisory, data on cloud, cloud 
security, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and 
private cloud;
•	 Expanding capabilities in key 
digital technology areas such 
as AI, product engineering, 
cybersecurity and human 
experience;
•	 Strengthening our employee value 
proposition for the newer contexts 
of work and workplace;
•	 Running our operations in a cost 
effective and agile manner with 
a comprehensive plan for margin 
expansion;
•	 Delivering on our ESG 
commitments, while also enabling 
our clients to realize their 
sustainability goals.
The way we navigate your next, every 
different next that you’re pursuing, is 
to view it holistically across capabilities, 
focus areas and desired outcomes.
We offer four distinct learnings and 
advantages to our clients.
First, we empower businesses with 
agile digital at scale. We do this by 
bringing together new technologies, 
the swiftness of agile delivery and our 
global delivery model to create new 
enterprise-wide capability that delivers 
unprecedented levels of business 
performance and customer delight.
Secondly, we enable enterprises 
with an AI-powered core. We build a 
deeply automated foundation that 
serves up vital insights to prioritize 
the execution of change. And we 
do this by not wishing away, but 
harnessing and energizing the core.
Third, our always-on learning agenda 
drives continuous improvement for 
them. We build and transfer digital 
skills, expertise and ideas from our 
innovation ecosystem to help them 
transition to new agile ways of working.
Lastly, we further complement this 
with the advantages of our expanded 
localization in the form of in-market 
state-of-the-art training facilities 
and innovation hubs that give our 
clients the benefit of proximity in 
co-creation.
We believe the investments we have 
made, and continue to make, in our 
strategy will enable us to advise and 
help our clients as they tackle the 
current market conditions. Over the 
last few years, we have executed 
on this strategy and generated 
significant outcomes.

Robust working capital
We obtain our Financial Capital through the funds generated from our 
business operations and financing activities. Our strong performance 
on the back of meticulous execution over the years, as reflected in the 
combination of high growth, strong cash generation and profitability, 
has led to building a strong, debt-free, and liquid Balance Sheet. Our 
focus is on ensuring a sustainable and profitable financial position. Our 
stakeholders expect us to deliver long-term growth riding on a solid 
strategy and prudent business decisions. Our shareholders are looking 
for good returns on their investment and steady capital returns. 
“Effective from financial year 2025, the Company 
expects to continue its policy of returning 
approximately 85% of the free cash flow cumulatively 
over a five-year period through a combination of 
semi-annual dividends and / or share buyback / 
special dividends, subject to applicable laws and 
requisite approvals, if any.”
The Company expects to progressively increase 
its annual dividend per share (excluding special 
dividend if, any).

Managing financial capital
Infosys has a high cash-generating 
business with access to capital 
markets across the world. Our strong 
credit rating allows us to raise debt 
at competitive rates in the future, 
if needed. The primary source of 
funds is cash from operations and 
income from short and long-term 
investments, among others.
Our primary sources of liquidity

Natural Capital
Delivering value
Decades before climate change emerged as a global boardroom 
priority, Infosys had recognized that natural capital is integral 
to long-term value creation. Our approach to managing 
environmental impact is holistic, scientific, and anchored in 
responsible growth. We have pledged to maintain carbon neutrality 
across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Our commitment goes beyond 
compliance – it is about leading by example and setting new 
standards in corporate climate responsibility.
We are now evolving from carbon neutrality to climate 
positivity – investing in regenerative practices, nature-
based solutions, and green innovation to restore 
ecosystems and capture more carbon than we emit. 
Our commitment is not just to reduce harm, but to 
create lasting environmental value.

Our 3-pillar strategy  
to climate action
To operationalize our climate 
ambitions, we have built a robust 
strategy anchored on three pillars – 
energy efficiency, renewable energy, 
and carbon offsets.
1. Energy efficiency
A culture of conscious 
consumption 
Infosys has been a pioneer in energy-
efficient infrastructure. Our campuses 
are equipped with cutting-edge 
technologies, such as radiant cooling 
systems and intelligent building 
designs. Over the past 15 years, we 
have implemented one of the world’s 
largest enterprise-level energy 
conservation programs, significantly 
reducing our energy intensity.
Today, we operate over 29.7 million 
sq.ft. of workspace certified to the 
highest levels of green building 
standards. This is not just about 
infrastructure – it’s about cultivating 
a culture where efficiency and 
sustainability go hand in hand.
2. Renewable energy
Accelerating clean transition
We have installed over 60 MW of 
solar photovoltaic capacity through 
rooftop and ground-mounted 
systems. In addition to generating 
clean energy onsite, we procure 
renewable power through third-party 
power purchase agreements and 
green tariff mechanisms from utility 
providers.
This comprehensive approach 
enables us to avoid emissions while 
supporting the larger shift towards 
decarbonized energy systems.
3. Carbon offsets
Creating impact beyond the 
organization
We address unavoidable emissions 
through community-centric carbon 
offset programs. Our projects are 
verified by the Gold Standard for their 
social and environmental impact. 
These projects include clean cook 
stove programs in Rajasthan and 
the distribution of biogas units in 
Maharashtra and Karnataka.
To date, our carbon offset initiatives 
have benefited over 2,72,000 rural 
families and created more than 3,900 
local jobs. We see these efforts not 
only as a way to meet our climate 
goals but also as an opportunity to 
uplift communities and improve lives.
Water stewardship: 
Conserving a vital resource
Water management has long been 
a cornerstone of our environmental 
strategy. As a signatory to the CEO 
Water Mandate, we are committed 
to minimizing water consumption 
and maximizing reuse. Our efforts 
continue to focus on improving water 
availability in the communities where 
we operate.
Our campuses recycle 100% of 
wastewater and have effective 
rainwater harvesting techniques 
for utilizing rainwater effectively. 
These initiatives, combined with 
demand side measures, have helped 
us minimize our water consumption 
and reduce dependency on external 
water sources. Our Bengaluru campus 
is certified water positive by CII 
based on NITI Aayog water neutrality 
guidelines.
Lake rejuvenation: Restoring 
ecosystems, supporting 
communities
We are extending our water 
stewardship efforts beyond our 
campuses through lake rejuvenation 
projects. Our goal is to increase 
water-holding capacity by over 10 
billion liters over five years. Infosys 
is working with local partners to 
improve water availability in the 
communities in which Infosys 
operates. In two years, we have 
achieved an increase of 4.3 billion 
liters in water holding capacity 
through 11 lake rejuvenation projects 
across India.
Read more in our ESG Report 2025.
Waste management: Towards 
a circular economy
At Infosys, our waste strategy 
is grounded in the principles of 
reduction, recovery, and reuse. We 
are steadily advancing towards 
our goal of zero waste to landfills. 
Organic waste, which accounts for 
approximately 75% of our total 
waste, is treated entirely onsite 
through composting and recycling 
mechanisms.
Our progress is aligned with the TRUE 
zero waste certification framework, 
reflecting our commitment to 
transparency and best-in-class waste 
management. Three of our campuses 
have received TRUE certification for 
zero waste.
Biodiversity: Breathing life 
into our campuses
We are focused on strengthening 
our efforts to preserve biodiversity 
and improve green cover at all our 
campuses. Our Mangaluru campus 
biodiversity book was launched 
online recently. The book highlights 
endemic species of the Western 
Ghats and offers a practical blueprint 
for others aiming to undertake 
similar initiatives in preserving 
biodiversity. Through this effort, we 
hope to inspire corporates, urban 
planners, and communities to make 
biodiversity a central consideration in 
shaping the spaces we live in and use.
ASSURE
Infosys has long led the way in 
sustainable, high-performance 
buildings, and with ASSURE 
(Accelerating Sustainable Super-
Efficient Real Estate), we are taking 
this impact to a national scale. 
Launched in partnership with 
the Indian Institute for Human 
Settlements (IIHS) on April 30, 2024, 
ASSURE is a multi-stakeholder 
platform that positions our campuses 
as living case studies, enabling 
the replication of climate-resilient, 
energy-efficient infrastructure. 
The initiative brings together 
global experts, policymakers, and 
industry leaders to shape a future 
where India’s buildings are radically 
more sustainable. With a goal of 
demonstrating 100 million sq.ft. of 
super-efficient commercial real estate 
by 2030, ASSURE focuses on sectors 
with the highest energy and emission 
intensity. The ASSURE program 
will provide technical support to 
developers, skill and upskill 12,000 
individuals, back 30 innovators, and 
advance performance measurement, 
policy, and financing mechanisms 
– all building on our own journey of 
saving over US$250 million through 
high-performance buildings.
Climate positivity: The next 
frontier
As we progress toward environmental 
stewardship, we are evolving from 
climate neutrality towards climate 
positivity – a paradigm where our 
actions go beyond neutralizing 
emissions to actively creating a net 
environmental benefit. Climate 
positivity includes investing in 
regenerative practices and green 
innovations that restore ecosystems, 
sequestering more carbon than we 
emit, and strengthening the planet’s 
resilience. At Infosys, we see this 
as a natural extension of our long-
standing sustainability ethos. By 
embedding climate-positive thinking 
into our operations, products, and 
community programs, we aim to 
redefine what corporate climate 
leadership looks like in the coming 
decades. It’s not just about doing less 
harm, but about doing more good.
As we look to the future, we remain 
committed to being a catalyst 
for positive change, proving that 
sustainable development is not just 
possible – it is essential.

Manufactured Capital
Our Manufactured Capital includes our energy-efficient offices, 
data centers, innovation hubs, digital studios, and our technology 
infrastructure across the globe. Our infrastructure is modeled 
taking into consideration stakeholder expectations of our 
commitments towards climate change mitigation, judicious use 
of natural resources and preserving our environment.
With the highest-rated green buildings on our 
campuses and investments in collaborative tech 
infrastructure, we offer productive, safe, healthy 
and hybrid workplaces for our employees. We 
continue to push the boundaries and define new 
benchmarks in environmental sustainability.
Pushing the boundaries of 
energy efficiency 
For a sustainable future, pushing 
the boundaries of energy efficiency 
in buildings is essential. Innovative 
design, advanced insulation, smart 
HVAC systems, and renewable 
energy integration are redefining 
possibilities. High-performance 
materials, passive solar techniques, 
and real-time energy monitoring 
reduce consumption and 
environmental impact. Net-zero and 
even energy-positive buildings are 
becoming viable goals. Emphasizing 
occupant comfort and health while 
minimizing resource use reflects 
a holistic approach to design. As 
technology evolves and awareness 
grows, we drive the ecosystem 
players – architects, engineers, and 
policymakers – to further stretch the 
limits of energy efficiency. 
An integrated approach to design, 
implementation of innovative 
technologies, and continuous 
performance monitoring and 
optimization have resulted in office 
buildings with an estimated Energy 
Performance Index (EPI) of lower 
than 65 kWh/sq.m. per annum. Every 
aspect of a building – from insulation 
to high-performance glass and 
shading, efficient mechanical and 
electrical systems to high-efficiency 
equipment with variable speed, 
building management system to 
granular performance monitoring 
of individual equipment – has been 
thoroughly studied for improvement 
in every new building that we design 
and construct across Infosys.
The lush green campuses of 
Infosys, equipped with world-class 
infrastructure, provides a unique 
experience for our employees. 
With about 29.7 million sq.ft. 
of the highest level of green 
building certification, Infosys’ 
leadership in high-performance 
buildings remains unrivaled. Our

Delivering value
platforms, which provide cloud-scale 
agility and enable efficient resource 
use, have been deployed to deliver 
high-density server virtualization 
and consolidation across the 
enterprise. This initiative has 
delivered significant power savings. 
Subsequently, data center and server 
rooms across development centers 
were consolidated which resulted in a 
reduction of over 600 KW of electrical 
load in FY25.
InfosysIT continues to make 
focused investments in Data Center 
Infrastructure Management (DCIM) 
tools to get accurate visibility across 
the entire data center IT and Facility 
stack for continuous optimization 
and further consolidation.
Infrastructure as code
Infrastructure as code is a 
transformational initiative towards 
enabling continuous deployment, 
continuous integration, and touch-
less management of the life cycle 
of infrastructure components. 
This methodology overcomes the 
traditional challenges such as growing 
scale of infrastructure, elastic demand, 
speed and consistency of deployment 
and interdependence between teams. 
This initiative delivered significant 
number of playbooks for automating 
platform‑related processes across 
hybrid cloud.
AIOps-powered digital operations
InfosysIT has implemented an 
advanced AIOps platform equipped 
with a broad range of capabilities, 
including algorithmic noise reduction 
and context-aware notifications.
The digital operations suite delivers 
unified observability across both 
infrastructure and application 
layers, while also providing insights 
into capacity utilization and cost 
efficiency. It is designed to ingest 
and process large volumes of data 
from diverse sources within the IT 
ecosystem. Leveraging AI, machine 
learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) 
algorithms, the platform identifies 
opportunities for remediation and 
optimization, driving operational 
excellence.
Public cloud adoption
Majority of internal IT applications 
have been moved to public cloud 
infrastructure. All our employees 
have been enabled for cloud-
based collaboration for messaging, 
presence, video, and other 
requirements. Additionally, cloud-
based unified internet access and 
secure private access has enhanced 
hybrid work experience. 
The shift to cloud has helped in 
optimizing the on-premises data 
center footprint and also to scale up 
the infra on demand and provision 
IT services seamlessly for all the new 
hires inducted into the organization.
Impactful workplace 
design
Infosys continued on its workplace 
transformation journey, to adapt to 
the hybrid future-ready scenario. 
The principles of Infosys workplace 
strategy are focused on productivity, 
social connect, use of tech, health 
and wellness, sustainability and 
design for all. These are being 
followed in all new workplace 
designs of Infosys. 
The new workplace designs align 
space with purpose, empowering 
people and teams to perform their 
best. We believe as work continues 
to evolve, so must our environments, 
making reimagined workplace design 
a catalyst for culture, innovation and 
long-term resilience.

efforts include developing super-
efficient new buildings, retrofitting 
existing buildings, a sharp focus 
on innovation and continuous 
monitoring to achieve the highest 
levels of efficiency. Infosys’ building 
standards have set new global 
benchmarks. 
Embodied carbon as an 
essential benchmark
As a key stakeholder in the built 
environment, we recognize the 
urgent need to address embodied 
carbon – the emissions associated 
with building materials and 
construction processes. While 
operational efficiency has advanced, 
embodied carbon remains a 
significant contributor to climate 
impact. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) 
is a critical tool for understanding 
and reducing these emissions, 
guiding smarter material choices 
and sustainable design strategies. By 
integrating LCA early in the design 
process, we can make informed 
decisions that align with climate 
goals. Leadership today means 
not only building efficiently, but 
responsibly, reducing embodied 
carbon to shape a resilient, low-
carbon future.
LCA has been an essential indicator 
for all our new buildings in fiscal 
2025. The LCA of our office buildings 
have been estimated in the range of 
650 – 900 kg CO2e/sq.m. 
Green IT
InfosysIT has embedded sustainable 
practices across the life cycles of 
service design, operations, and 
disposal of IT assets. 
Data center efficiency
InfosysIT has taken up data center 
modernization as a strategic initiative.

Capital Allocation Policy 
"Effective from financial year 2025, the Company expects to 
continue its policy of returning approximately 85% of the 
free cash flow cumulatively over a five-year period through a 
combination of semi-annual dividends and / or share buyback 
/ special dividends, subject to applicable laws and requisite 
approvals, if any." Under this policy, the Company expects to 
progressively increase its annual dividend per share (excluding 
special dividend, if any). Free cash flow is defined as net cash 
provided by operating activities less capital expenditure as per 
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prepared under IFRS. 
Dividend and buyback include applicable taxes.
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company paid 
an interim dividend of ₹21 per equity share and announced 
a final dividend of ₹22 per share, subject to shareholders’ 
approval in the ensuing Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
Including the final dividend declared above, the Company has 
returned approximately `17,814 crore, which is 51.6% of the 
free cash flow for fiscal 2025 through dividends, in line with the 
Capital Allocation Policy.
The Capital Allocation Policy is available on our website, at 
https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/ 
documents/capital-allocation-policy.pdf.
Liquidity
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, 
investments and the cash flow that we generate from our 
operations. We continue to be debt-free and maintain sufficient 
cash to meet our strategic and operational requirements. We 
understand that liquidity in the Balance Sheet has to balance 
between earning adequate returns and the need to cover 
financial and business requirements. Liquidity enables us to be 
agile and ready for meeting unforeseen strategic and business 
needs and opportunities.
As of March 31, 2025, we had ₹45,406 crore in working capital on 
a standalone basis, and ₹54,249 crore on a consolidated basis.
Consolidated cash and investments stand at `35,916 crore on a 
standalone basis and ₹47,549 crore on a consolidated basis as on 
March 31, 2025, as against ₹30,579 crore on a standalone basis, 
and ₹39,005 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2024.
Consolidated cash and investments, on both standalone and 
consolidated basis, include deposits with banks with high credit 
ratings by international and domestic credit rating agencies. 
As a result, liquidity risk of cash and cash equivalents is limited. 
Ratings are monitored periodically. Liquid assets also include 
investments in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity funds 
units, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), Commercial Paper (CP), 
quoted bonds and securities issued by government and quasi-
government organizations, and non-convertible debentures. CDs 
and CPs represent marketable securities of banks, Non-Banking 
Financial Companies (NBFCs) and eligible financial institutions for 
a specified time period with high credit rating given by domestic 
credit rating agencies. Government securities are highly liquid 
and marketable instruments issued across tenure, backed by the 
Government of India carrying a sovereign credit. Investments 
made in non-convertible debentures are issued by government-
owned institutions and financial institutions with high credit 
rating. We invest after considering counterparty risks based on 
multiple criteria including Tier-I capital, capital adequacy ratio, 
credit rating, profitability, Non Performing Asset (NPA) levels and 
deposit base of banks and financial institutions.
The details of these investments are disclosed under 
the ‘non-current and current investments’ section in the 
Standalone and Consolidated financial statements in this 
Integrated Annual Report.

collaborative, transparent and participative organizational culture, 
and rewarding merit and sustained high performance. Our human 
resources management focuses on allowing our employees to 
develop their skills, grow in their career and navigate their next. 
Resolution hubs
Infosys’ unwavering commitment has always been to foster 
an open, inclusive and safe workplace where every employee 
can thrive. The organization’s goal is to ensure that employees, 
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or any other 
distinguishing factors, feel empowered to contribute to the 
best of their abilities. In line with this, we encourage an open-
door policy that allows employees to voice their concerns and 
seek support through Resolution hubs comprising Hearing 
Employees and Resolving (HEAR) for workplace-related issues and 
Anti-Sexual Harassment Initiative (ASHI) for sexual harassment 
complaints. Our forums include a well-established and robust 
grievance resolution mechanism.
Resolution hubs adhere to the principles of natural justice, 
ensure confidentiality, and non-retaliation while addressing 
concerns. The concerns are handled with utmost sensitivity 
and are redressed in a time-bound manner. A detailed 
investigation is conducted to ensure fairness and provide 
an opportunity to present facts and any material evidence 
pertaining to the grievance.
Our ASHI initiative has set an industry benchmark, being 
ranked first among 350+ companies that participated in an 
external survey on the best anti-sexual harassment initiatives 
in 2017 and 2019-2024.
Infosys has constituted an Internal Committee (IC) in all the 
development centers of the Company in India to consider and 
resolve all sexual harassment complaints reported by women. 
The IC has been constituted as per the Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) 
Act, 2013, and the committee includes external members from 
non-governmental organizations or with relevant experience. 
Investigations are conducted and decisions made by the IC at 
the respective locations, with a senior female employee serving 
Board’s report

as the presiding officer in each case. Half of the total members 
of the IC are women. The role of the IC is not restricted to mere 
redressal of complaints but also encompasses prevention and 
prohibition of sexual harassment. In the last few years, the IC 
has worked extensively on creating awareness on relevance of 
sexual harassment issues in the new normal by using new and 
innovative measures to help employees understand the forms of

harassment complaints that were filed, resolved and pending

4.	Executive summary along with web-link(s) of Impact Assessment of CSR Projects carried out in pursuance of sub-
rule (3) of rule 8, if applicable: 
The Company has been implementing various CSR projects for holistic community development and institution building to serve the 
enrichment and evolution of businesses and communities. For fiscal 2025, the Company has engaged an external agency to provide 
support and assistance for an independent review and impact assessment.
Methodology:
In order to assess the impact of its CSR projects, a mixed-method approach was deployed which involved either one of or both the 
quantitative and qualitative research tools (as relevant) for primary data collection. Using these tools, the team conducted interactions 
(virtual and on-field) with the project beneficiaries and other relevant stakeholders. Post data collection and analysis, the key insights 
and findings were collated in the form of a consolidated report for the Management’s consideration. This study was guided by 
the Inclusiveness, Relevance, Effectiveness, Convergence and Sustainability (IRECS) Framework which was used to provide overall 
feedback on the efficacy of implementation as well, as its efficiency in terms of achievement of the desired project outputs with 
reference to inputs.
Summary:
During the year, impact assessment study was conducted on 26 eligible CSR projects which impacted 1.3 crore beneficiaries across 
various states in India. These projects align with the ESG framework and support 13 of the UN SDG goals which cover the broad themes 
of education, healthcare, women empowerment, sustainability and others.

Annexure 7 – Conservation of energy, research and development, technology 
absorption, foreign exchange earnings and outgo.
[Particulars pursuant to the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014]
Our focused approach on energy efficiency, renewable energy 
and carbon offset projects over the years resulted in the 
Company achieving carbon neutrality for six years in a row 
since fiscal 2020, across all emissions. As we continue to remain 
carbon neutral for fiscal 2025, we have started to work towards 
climate positivity, aiming to restore more than we consume 
and to contribute actively to the health of our ecosystems and 
communities. We are thereby increasing our efforts in the global 
response to the threat of climate change.  
Resource conservation initiatives
Resource conservation initiatives at Infosys have been 
focused, continuous and imbibed in our operations and new 
infrastructure development. The introduction of highly efficient 
new buildings, major improvements in existing buildings, 
intelligent automation, water management plans, and waste 
treatment and management projects have significantly reduced 
our environmental impact. 
The increased adoption of renewable energy in our operations 
has helped avoid emissions significantly, and our high-
impact carbon offset projects have enabled us to offset 
unavoidable emissions. 
Energy: Infosys has demonstrated a strong commitment to 
energy conservation through a series of initiatives to improve 
operational efficiency and reduce overall consumption through 
cutting edge building designs, operational optimization and 
employee engagement. By combining innovative technologies 
with operational discipline, we have consistently reduced 
our energy intensity year after year. These efforts underscore 
Infosys’ belief that systematic, technology-driven conservation 
strategies are crucial to achieving meaningful progress towards 
sustainability goals. In fiscal 2025, while our new buildings were 
designed to new energy efficiency benchmarks, about `10.7 
crore was spent on retrofits in some of our older infrastructure to 
improve operational efficiency.
In an effort to replicate the success of high-efficiency building 
design and operations on a larger scale, Infosys launched a 
unique initiative ‘ASSURE’ (Accelerating Sustainable and Super-
efficient Real Estate) in partnership with the Indian Institute 
for Human Settlements. ASSURE has a vision of accelerating 
decarbonization in the Indian building sector, by creating 
lighthouse projects, skilling students and practitioners, advocacy 
and other activities involving various stakeholders in the 
ecosystem. Our leadership is expected to drive a transformative 
shift towards climate-resilient buildings and align urban growth 
with India’s broader goals under the Paris Agreement and 
contribute to a low-carbon future.
Renewable energy: Infosys has a total installed solar capacity 
of 60 MW across campuses including, a 40 MW captive solar 
plant in Karnataka. Additionally, the Company leverages Power 
Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green tariffs to expand its clean 
energy portfolio. Infosys is steadily reducing its dependence 
on fossil fuels and accelerating the shift to a low-carbon future. 
In fiscal 2025, 77.7% of our electricity in India operations was 
met through renewables.
Green buildings: All new developments are designed to achieve 
the highest level of green building certification, with about 29.7 
million square feet of Infosys’ operational space already certified. 
Reinforcing Infosys’ commitment to energy efficiency, resource 
conservation and low-carbon operations. 
Smarter spaces: Infosys is reimagining the future workplace 
through its “workplace transformation” initiative, aligning 
office design with hybrid work models and sustainability goals. 
Next generation offices are digitally connected, ergonomically 
designed, and powered by intelligent energy systems that 
adapt to real-time usage. Building Management Systems (BMS) 
optimize lighting, ventilation, and cooling to minimize energy 
waste. By promoting flexible working practices and creating 
energy-efficient, human-centered environments, we are 
enhancing employee well-being while significantly reducing our 
operational footprint.
Water management: Committed to climate-positive goals, the 
Company ensures zero wastewater discharge, has endorsed the 
UN CEO Water Mandate, and aims to recharge more water than 
it consumes by 2030. Our efforts include demand reduction 
measures, wastewater recycling and rainwater harvesting 
initiatives. We have also implemented lake rejuvenation 
projects for larger community impact. Additionally, we are also 
sensitizing our employees on environmental protection and 
working with local stakeholders to improve water security to 
set industry benchmarks while addressing operational and 
ecological resilience.
Waste management: We are aiming for zero waste to landfill 
while aligning with sustainability goals such as the GRI 306 
and Scope 3 emissions standards. Infosys adopts the principles 
of circular economy to minimize environmental impact. 
Key initiatives around segregation, effective treatment and 
management have resulted in achieving over 98% waste 
diversion from landfill in fiscal 2025. Three of our campuses have 
achieved TRUE certification for zero waste by the Green Business 
Certification Institute.
Carbon offset: Infosys addresses unavoidable emissions 
through community-based carbon offset projects. Projects 
in the clean cooking space implemented in four states 
across India have improved livelihoods and helped generate 
income for rural women. 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

We are also implementing large-scale carbon sequestration 
projects through nature-based solutions, including agroforestry 
initiatives. These projects go beyond environmental benefits, 
positively impacting small and marginal farmers by improving 
soil health, food security, and climate resilience. 
Carbon neutral events: Infosys is committed to hosting carbon 
neutral events as part of its broader climate action strategy. 
Infosys ensures that all event-related emissions are carefully 
measured, minimized, and offset through certified projects. 
This approach not only reinforces the Company’s pledge toward 
climate positivity, but also demonstrates Infosys’ intent to 
extend our sustainability practices to external-facing events 
as well. In fiscal 2025, eight events organized by Infosys were 
declared carbon neutral.
Health, Safety and Environment 
Our Health, Safety, and Environmental Management System 
(HSEMS) reflects our commitment to creating a safe, healthy, 
and sustainable workplace for employees, contractors, and 
visitors alike. Aligned with our broader climate and sustainability 
goals, Infosys is certified to ISO 14001:2015 for Environmental 
Management and ISO 45001:2018 for Occupational Health 
and Safety. The HSEMS is built on a strong framework of 
compliance, taking into account the needs of all stakeholders 
and ensuring adherence to applicable laws across all 
regions where we operate.
Technology absorption
Live Enterprise@Infosys: An enterprise that senses, feels 
and responds in real-time – this has been the theme of our 
transformation journey in the recent years. We have used a 
mobile-first approach so that employees are connected to the 
organization wherever they are and can access the organization’s 
resources to learn and contribute. The response has been 
phenomenal as over 2,50,000 unique users use InfyMe mobile 
app every month for its 300+ features and more than 77,000 
users have rated it 4.6/5 on the Google Play Store. With process 
bursting, we have seen many of our key processes become 
faster and more responsive. Following the overwhelming 
success in Infosys, we are also seeing interest of the Orbit 
platform (InfyMe version for our clients) and have more than 
12 clients using the same.
Modern, hybrid, and secure workplace: Our hybrid workplace 
uses borderless ODCs, virtual collaboration tools, and self-
service applications to enable employees to work from 
anywhere. Our IT management system protects data and our 
brand by continuously assessing vulnerabilities. Collaborative 
tools foster innovation and teamwork. Employees are enabled 
with AI-powered systems and tools to enhance productivity 
and decision-making, allowing the automation of repetitive 
tasks and improving customer experience. The cloud-first 
approach has helped in migrating our key security tools from 
legacy on-premises platforms to scalable, faster, and efficient 
hybrid and cloud-based solutions. This supports modern 
management, fosters innovation, improves user experience, and 
ensures data security.
Energy efficient IT infrastructure 
We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to make our network 
and computer workload energy-efficient and environment-
friendly. Some of the measures implemented are:
Energy efficient network infrastructure: InfosysIT uses network 
gears with power saving features to enhance energy efficiency. 
Public cloud adoption: Majority of internal IT applications have 
been moved to public cloud infrastructure. All our employees 
have been enabled for cloud-based collaboration for messaging, 
presence, video, and other requirements. In addition, cloud-
based unified internet access and secure private access has 
improved hybrid work experience.
The shift to cloud has helped in optimizing the on-premises data 
center footprint and also to scale up the infra on demand and 
provision IT services seamlessly for all the new hires inducted 
into the organization.
Data center modernization: A strategic initiative launched by 
InfosysIT to modernize the data center IT landscape to make it 
future-ready continues to yield high rewards. Density-optimized 
hyperscale platforms were deployed to enable high-density 
server virtualization and consolidation across the enterprise. 
Hyperscale platforms are open-source driven infrastructure 
innovations that enable cloud-scale agility and efficient 
resource pooling and utilization. This initiative is delivering 
significant power savings and reduce the total cost of ownership 
for the organization.
InfosysIT has invested on the Data Center Infrastructure 
Management (DCIM) tool to get accurate visibility across the 
entire data centre IT and facility stack, which is the foundation for 
optimization initiatives.
Enterprise storage: The internal IT team provides all our delivery 
units with multi-protocol storage using flash, fabric pool 
and storage grid technology, which is a highly efficient and 
innovative approach to managing storage capacity. This not only 
saves data center footprint, but also reduces power consumption 
and cooling requirements, leading to overall operational savings.
Hybrid cloud storage is also used for some workloads with built-
in data protection and seamless scaling, eliminating the need for 
buffer investments and achieving savings over on-premises data 
center space, power consumption and cooling.
Cloud-native development environment: The open source-based 
cloud-native development platform is built on Hyper Converged 
Infrastructure (HCI) and compute, which has helped reduce data 
center footprint, power and cooling consumption.

Management’s discussion and analysis
Statutory reports
Overview
Infosys is a leading provider of consulting, technology, 
outsourcing and next-generation digital services, enabling 
clients to create and execute strategies for their digital 
transformation and AI journey. 
Our purpose is to amplify human potential and create the next 
opportunity for people, business and communities. We are 
guided by our value system which motivates our attitudes and 
actions. Our core values are Client value, Leadership by example, 
Integrity and transparency, Fairness, and Excellence (C-LIFE). 
Our strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization 
that remains relevant to the agenda of our clients, while 
creating growth opportunities for our employees, generating 
profitable growth for our investors and contributing to the 
communities that we operate in. There are numerous risks and 
challenges affecting our business. These are discussed in the Risk 
management report section of the Integrated Annual Report.
I.	
Industry structure and developments
Fiscal 2025 saw uncertainties related to interest rates, geopolitical 
conditions and elections across major economies compounding 
the ongoing transformation within the Tech services industry. 
The year has been another year of major uncertainties in the 
economy, some geopolitical flux, and novel concerns around 
protectionism led disruption of global balances. The high 
inflation and interest rates are driving down discretionary 
spending. The year has been a year of subdued growth, pockets 
of economic green shoots that have kept technology-led growth 
active. AI, has unified perspectives of the industry as well as 
government across geographies and sectors alike.
Global GDP is estimated to have grown at 3.2% in CY 2024(1), 
down 10bps compared to the previous year. The IT services 
growth during the same period has remained flat at 4.7%(2). We 
expect client spending and investments to continue to move 
towards AI in the near term. These investments are expected to 
be crucial during this period of economic uncertainty.
The dynamism in technologies continues and the industry is 
feeling the pressure to build AI strategies and stay ahead. We saw 
AI starting to reshape the industry in fiscal 2025. We continued 
to witness businesses attempting to reimagine their cost 
structures, increase business resilience and agility, personalize 
experiences for customers and employees, and launch new and 
disruptive products and services, aided by enterprise AI. With our 
leadership position in AI, we believe we are well-positioned to 
take advantage of these market opportunities. 
For more information, refer to Our business context section of the 
Integrated Annual Report.

(2)	 IDC – Technology Spend Forecast
II.	 Opportunities and threats
Our strategy
Our clients and prospective clients are faced with transformative 
business opportunities due to advances in software and 
computing technology. These organizations are dealing with 
the challenge of having to reinvent their processes and systems 
rapidly in the AI era. This needs an understanding of new 
technologies and new ways of working, and also appreciation 
of AI landscapes, business processes and practices. Our strategy 
is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and 
execute on their journey to an AI future by building strong data 
foundations with robust cloud capabilities. We are progressing 
well on our journey to leverage AI to deliver business value with 
safeguards around privacy, ethics, and controls.
Our strengths
We believe that we are well-positioned for the principal 
competitive factors in our business. With more than four decades 
of experience in managing the systems and workings of global 
enterprises, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help 
them steer through their AI transformation as we have built our 
own AI-first strategy and continue to invest in strengthening 
our AI capabilities.
Our competition
We see intense competition in traditional services, a rapidly 
changing marketplace and the emergence of new players in 
niche technology areas. We have invested in building proprietary 
intellectual property in software platforms and products. We 
have continued to invest in Infosys Cobalt – a set of services, 
solutions and platforms for enterprises to accelerate their cloud 
journey, Infosys Topaz – a set of AI-first services, solutions and 
platforms using generative AI technology and Infosys Aster – an 
AI-amplified Marketing Suite.

On a standalone basis, during the year, we invested additionally 
in our subsidiaries, for the purpose of acquisition of entities, 
operations and expansions.
Refer to Annexure 1 to the Board’s report for the statement 
pursuant to Section 129(3) of the Companies Act, 2013, for 
the summary of the financial performance of our subsidiaries. 
The audited financial statements and related information of 
subsidiaries will be available on our website, at www.infosys.com.
We invest in the startup ecosystem to gain access to innovations 
that, when combined with our services and solutions, can benefit 
our clients. These investments are typically minority equity 
positions in startup companies and / or venture capital funds. 
Our investments comprise liquid mutual funds units, target 
maturity fund units, tax-free bonds, non-convertible debentures, 
certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government securities 
(G-secs) and quoted bonds and securities issued by government 
and quasi-government organizations. Certificates of deposit 
and commercial papers represent marketable securities of 
banks, NBFCs and eligible financial institutions for a specified 
time period with high credit rating by domestic credit rating 
agencies. G-secs are highly liquid and marketable instruments 
issued across tenure, backed by the Government of India 
and carrying a sovereign credit. Investments made in non-
convertible debentures represent debt instruments issued by 
government-aided institutions and financial institutions with 
high credit rating. The majority of investments of the Company 
are fair valued based on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. The Company 
invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple 
criteria, including Tier-I capital, capital adequacy ratio, credit 
rating, profitability, Non-performing assets (NPA) levels and 
deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are 
monitored regularly as part of our risk management program.
B.	 Trade receivables

March 31, 2025, compared to 71 days in the previous year. 
C.	 Cash and cash equivalents

We provide loans to subsidiaries as per business requirement. 
E.	 Other financial assets
Restricted deposits represent amounts deposited with 
financial institutions to settle employee-related obligations

entered into to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on 
foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts 
is generally a bank. 
6.	 Other assets
Unbilled revenues are classified as non-financial asset where 
the right to consideration is dependent on completion of 
contractual milestones. Withholding taxes and others represent 
credits that can be availed against local taxes payable in 
various countries. Deferred contract cost mainly comprises 
the cost of obtaining a contract and the cost of fulfilling a 
contract recorded in accordance with Ind AS 115, Revenue from

less deferred tax assets. Deferred tax liability is primarily on 
account of temporary difference in the Special Economic Zone 
Re-investment Reserve, intangibles from business combination, 
interest receivable on income tax refund for orders received 
partially offset by deferred tax asset on property, plant and 
equipment, lease liabilities, allowances for trade receivables and 
compensated absences.
8.	 Income tax assets / liabilities
Our net profit earned from providing software development 
and other services outside India is subject to tax in the country 
where we perform the work. Most of our taxes paid in countries 
other than India can be claimed as credit against our tax 
liabilities in India.
9.	 Financial liabilities
Liabilities for accrued compensation to employees include 
the provision for bonus, accrued salaries, incentives and 
retention bonus payable to the staff. Financial liability under 
option arrangements represents redemption liability towards

operational expenses. Compensated absences are both 
accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected 
cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by 
actuarial valuation. Other financial liability includes financing 
arrangements entered into by the Company with a third party 
towards deferred contract cost assets.

During fiscal 2025, the Company continued running Project Maximus, a comprehensive margin expansion program structured across 
five pillars – Value-Based Selling; Efficient Pyramid; Lean and Automation; Improving Critical Portfolios, and Reducing Indirect Costs. 
Value-Based Selling is a focused strategy to identify opportunities to align pricing to the value that clients received for the services. Lean

1.	 Revenue
The growth in our revenues in fiscal 2025 from fiscal 2024 is as follows:

6.1 
The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase 
in realization on account of Value-Based Selling, productivity 
benefit from Lean and Automation, currency, acquisition and 
revenue mix partially offset by decline in volume.
Revenue growth in reported terms includes the impact of 
currency fluctuations. We, therefore, additionally report the 
revenue growth in constant currency terms, which represents 
the real growth in revenue, excluding the impact of currency 
fluctuations. We calculate constant currency growth by 
comparing current-period revenues in respective local currencies 
converted to USD using prior-period exchange rates and 
comparing the same to our prior-period reported revenues. Our 
revenues in reported currency terms for fiscal 2025 is ₹1,62,990 
crore, a growth of 6.1%. Our revenues for fiscal 2025 in constant 
currency grew by 4.2%.
We added 365 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2025 as 
compared to 385 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2024.
On a consolidated basis, for the year ended March 31, 2025, 
approximately 96.9% were export revenues whereas 3.1% were 
domestic revenues, while for the year ended March 31, 2024, 
97.5% were export revenues whereas 2.5% were domestic 
revenues. Refer to the ‘Segmental profitability’ section in this 
report for more details on the analysis of segment revenues.
2. Expenditure
Cost of sales 
The cost of sales have decreased as a percentage of revenue by 
0.2% on standalone basis and by 0.4% on consolidated basis 
in fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024. The cost of efforts, comprising 
employee cost and cost of technical sub-contractors, has 
decreased as a percentage of revenue from 60.2% in fiscal 2024 
to 58.8% in fiscal 2025 on a standalone basis, and from 56.4% in 
fiscal 2024 to 55.4% in fiscal 2025 on a consolidated basis. 
The cost of efforts as a percentage of revenue has decreased 
mainly on account of improved onsite mix, utilization and 
increase in third-party costs.
Third-party items bought for service delivery to clients include 
software and hardware, which are integral to our overall service 
delivery to clients.
Selling and marketing expenses
The selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
on standalone basis and consolidated basis have increased by 
0.2% in fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024.

Management’s discussion and analysis
General and administration expenses
The general and administration expenses as a percentage of 
revenue on standalone and consolidated basis have decreased 
by 0.3% and 0.2% respectively in fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024. 
Contribution towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on 
standalone basis is ₹540 crore and ₹492 crore for fiscal 2025 and 
2024, respectively. On consolidated basis is ₹585 crore and ₹533 
crore for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.
3.	 Other income and finance cost
Other income primarily includes income from investments, gain 
/ loss on investments, foreign exchange gain / loss on forward 
and options contracts, foreign exchange gain / loss on translation 
of other assets and liabilities and interest on income tax refund. 
Other income for fiscal 2025 includes interest (pre-tax) on income 
tax refund of ₹327 crore on account of orders received under 
Sections 250 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the income tax 
authorities in India for certain assessment years. Other income 
for fiscal 2024 includes interest (pre-tax) on income tax refund 
of ₹1,933 crore on account of orders received under Sections 
250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the income tax 
authorities in India for certain assessment years. In fiscal 2025, the 
Company received ₹1,522 crore of dividend from our subsidiaries, 
which is reflected in the Standalone financial statement.
Interest income in fiscal 2025 has increased as compared to fiscal 
2024 primarily due to increase in investible base and increase 
in yield on investments. We use foreign exchange forward and 
options contracts to hedge our exposure against movements in 
foreign exchange rates. Finance cost is on account of leases. The 
lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in 
the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental 
borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases.
4.	 Provision for tax
We have provided for our tax liability both in India and overseas. 
The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 has introduced 
Section 115BAA wherein a domestic company can exercise 
option for a reduced rate of corporate tax without claim of 
certain deductions mentioned therein including deduction for 
SEZ units under Section 10AA of the Income-tax Act, 1961. For 
the fiscal 2025, the income tax expense of the Company has been 
recognized by applying the provision of Section 115BAA of the 
Income-tax Act without claim of deduction for SEZ units under 
Section 10AA of the Income-tax Act.

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 was lower primarily on 
account of reversal of tax provision due to receipt of order 
giving effects in fiscal 2024 for prior assessment years. Effective 
tax rate is generally influenced by various factors including 
non-deductible expenses, exempt non-operating income, 
overseas taxes, tax reversals and provisions pertaining to prior 
periods, changes to tax regulations and other tax deductions. 
Tax reversals and provisions pertaining to prior periods are 
primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, 
upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across 
various jurisdictions.
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company received 
orders under Section 250 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the 
Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2016-17 
and 2019-20. These orders confirmed the Company's position 
with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a 
result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹327 crore was recognised and 
provision for income tax aggregating ₹183 crore was reversed 
with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to 
₹1,068 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received 
orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, 
from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment 
years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders 
confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment 
of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income 
(pretax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognised and provision for income 
tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding 
credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution 
of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been 
reduced from contingent liabilities.

Overall segment profitability has increased primarily on account 
of an increase in foreign currency translation benefits, benefit 
from Project Maximus arising from Value-Based Selling, and 
Lean and Automation, improved utilization, and an insurance 
claim receivable relating to a cyber event pertaining to fiscal 
2024, partially offset by higher employee compensation, higher 
cost of third-party items bought for service delivery to clients 
and acquisition impact.
6.	 Liquidity
Our principal source of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents 
and cash flow that we generate from operations. We have no 
outstanding borrowings. We believe our working capital is 
sufficient for our requirements. 
Our growth has been financed largely through cash 
generated from operations.
Our cash flows are robust. Our operating cash flows have 
increased in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 mainly on 
account of increase in net profit adjusted for non-cash items, 
better working capital management partially and by lower net 
income tax payments due to higher tax refunds.
Consolidated cash and investments of ₹47,549 crore 
comprise cash and cash equivalents, current and non-
current investments excluding investments in equity and 
preference shares and others.

V.	 Outlook, risks and concerns
We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is 
implemented across the organization by the risk management 
office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the 
best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to 
suit our unique business requirements.
We have provided the details of Infosys ERM framework, key and 
emerging risks along with mitigation in the Risk management 
report of this Integrated Annual Report. The list of risk factors 
which we track for our business are covered in our 20-F filing

VI.	 Internal financial control systems and their 
adequacy
Infosys has aligned its current systems of internal financial 
control with the requirement of Companies Act, 2013, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to 
increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s 
process of designing and implementing a system of internal 
control. The framework requires a company to identify and 
analyze risks and manage appropriate responses.
Internal financial control systems include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that are operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the 
Company’s policies, safeguarding of its assets, prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and 
procedures, the Management recognizes that any controls 
and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, 
can only provide reasonable assurance that the objectives 
of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Based on 
their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this 
Integrated Annual Report, our CEO and CFO have concluded 
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to 
provide reasonable assurance that the information required 
to be disclosed in filings and submissions, is recorded, 
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods 
specified, and that material information related to us and our 
consolidated subsidiaries is accumulated and communicated to 
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions about 
required disclosure.

and ensured a safe and positive work environment for all 
its employees. Infosys has also received several awards and 
accolades for its best-in-class HR practices and processes.
Resolution hubs
Infosys is committed to providing a safe and positive work 
environment. In keeping with this philosophy, the organization 
envisages an open-door policy and encourages a culture of 
“speak up”. Employees also have access to several forums 
where they can highlight matters or concerns faced at the 
workplace for effective remediation. This is achieved through 
a well-established and robust grievance resolution mechanism 
comprising resolution hubs. Resolution hubs adhere to the 
principles of natural justice, confidentiality, sensitivity, non-
retaliation and fairness, while addressing concerns. The concerns 
are handled objectively while ensuring timely action and closure. 
In matters that entail a detailed investigation, the process 
ensures fairness for all involved, with an opportunity to be heard, 
present facts and any material evidence before a neutral panel.
HEAR
Infosys has a robust grievance redressal forum called HEAR 
(Hearing Employees And Resolving) fostering healthy employee 
relations and a positive work environment by giving our 
employees a neutral platform ‘to be heard’ and building the 
culture of ‘speak up’. Employees can raise a complaint on the 
HEAR webapp or InfyMe mobile application or write to HEAR@
infosys.com. HEAR adopts a decentralized model and addresses 
employee concerns in a structured manner with appellate forums 
for workplace grievances that have not been duly heard at the 
preliminary level by the Managers (or) line HR.
ASHI
The Company’s assurance to its employees of providing a 
harassment-free workplace is reflected in our key initiative, ASHI 
(Anti-Sexual Harassment Initiative). As per the Prevention of 
Sexual Harassment Act in India, the Company has constituted 
Internal Committees (IC) in all the development centers with 
the ambit of the regulatory jurisdiction, for redressal of sexual 
harassment matters reported by women employees. We also 
have a strong governance mechanism in the form of GRB 
(Grievance Redressal Body) to define, interpret and implement 
the Company’s policy on prevention of sexual harassment at 
the workplace. GRB consists of external members, internal 
senior members, and the Investigative Council. Here, we follow 
a gender-neutral approach in redressal of all such complaints. 
Complaints are taken up for a formal redressal process in line 
with the POSH Act and the Company’s policy on anti-harassment 
as applicable. The reports on ASHI grievances can be shared to 
GRB@infosys.com and employees can also report complaints on 
the ASHI webapp or InfyMe mobile application.
Extending the initiative to contract staff
Our commitment to a positive and safe working environment 
is not restricted only to our employees, but also third parties, 
who provide services in our campuses. We conduct refresher 
sessions for such third-party employees to reinforce the message. 
These sessions are covered in nine vernacular languages in India 
currently. Emergency / safety cards with important contact 
numbers are also handed over to all Infosys employees and 
employees of such third parties.
Whistleblower Policy
The Company has formulated the Whistleblower Policy in 
line with the mandated regulatory requirements – Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (SOX), 2002 & Companies Act, 2013 – which 
mandates listed companies to establish a “vigil mechanism” for 
reporting genuine concerns.
The forum is predominantly for the receipt, retention and 
treatment of complaints regarding matters of probable 
discrepancies in accounting, internal accounting controls or 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
106
Management’s discussion and analysis
auditing, and also enables anonymous reporting by employees. 
While the Whistleblower Policy and the forum is administered 
and managed by the Office of Integrity and Compliance, 
complaints (anonymous or otherwise) pertaining to deviations in 
workplace policies / processes involving employees are reviewed 
in tandem by the Employee Relations Department.
Human rights
Infosys is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC) and supports the protection and elevation of human 
rights. Our stand on human rights is contained in an important 
pillar of our Code of Conduct, viz., ‘Respecting each other.’ Refer

affairs are managed in a fair and transparent manner. This is vital 
to gain and retain the trust of our stakeholders. This is ensured 
by taking ethical business decisions and conducting business 
with a firm commitment to values, while meeting stakeholders’ 
expectations. We are committed to defining, following and 
practicing the highest level of corporate governance across all 
our business functions. 
Our corporate governance is a statement of the values we 
stand by as we conduct our business and engage with our 
stakeholders. Our Company has been a leader in adopting

Board as a trustee
The Board recognizes its primary role of trusteeship of shareholder capital. 
As a trustee, it strives to ensure excellence and integrity in setting world-class 
corporate governance standards.
Corporate governance guidelines
Strong corporate governance is the bedrock of our sustained 
performance and has helped us gain the trust and respect 
of all our stakeholders. The enhancement of these corporate 
governance standards, through periodic evaluation and change, 
is one of the most important aspects of ensuring value creation 
for our stakeholders. 
Our corporate governance follows the guidelines established 
by the Board of the Company. These guidelines provide a 
structure within which directors and the Management can 
effectively pursue the Company’s objectives for the benefit 
of its stakeholders. These are framed in conjunction with the 
Company’s Memorandum & Articles of Association, the charters 
of the committees of the Board and applicable laws / regulations 
/ guidelines in force in India, the US and other jurisdictions, as 
applicable. The guidelines can be accessed on our website, at 
https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/
Documents/corporate-governance-guidelines.pdf.
Role of the Board of Directors
The primary role of the Board is that of trusteeship – to protect 
and enhance shareholder value. As trustees, the Board has a 
fiduciary responsibility to ensure that the Company has clear 
goals aligned to shareholder value and its growth. Further, the 
Board is also responsible for:
•	
Exercising appropriate control to ensure that the Company 
is managed efficiently to fulfil stakeholders’ aspirations and 
societal expectations.
•	
Monitoring the effectiveness of the Company’s governance 
practices and making changes as necessary.
•	
Providing strategic guidance to the Company and ensuring 
effective monitoring of the Management.
•	
Exercising independent judgment on corporate affairs.
•	
Assigning a sufficient number of non-executive members of 
the Board to tasks where there is a potential for conflict of 
interest in the exercise of independent judgment.
•	
Reviewing and guiding corporate strategy, major plans 
of action, risk policy, annual budgets and business plans, 
setting performance objectives, monitoring implementation 
and corporate performance, and overseeing major capital 
expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.
Independent directors

and in the opinion of the Board, the independent directors fulfil 
the conditions specified in the Act, the Listing Regulations, NYSE 
listing manual and are independent of the Management.
Board composition
The Company recognizes and embraces the importance of a 
diverse Board in its success. We believe that a truly diverse Board 
will leverage differences in thought, perspective, regional and 
industry experience, cultural and geographical background, 
age, ethnicity, race, gender, knowledge, skills including 
expertise in financial, global business, leadership, technology, 
mergers and acquisition, Board service, strategy, sales and

along with explanatory notes is circulated to the directors in 
advance to facilitate informed deliberation and decision making. 
Every Board member can suggest the inclusion of additional 
items in the agenda. 
The Board meets at least once a quarter to review the quarterly 
results and other items on the agenda. Additional meetings 
are held when necessary. Independent directors are expected 
to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM). However, with the Board 
being represented by independent directors from various 
parts of the world, it may not be possible for all of them to be 
physically present at all meetings. Hence, we provide video / 
teleconferencing facilities to enable their participation.
The Board members are expected to rigorously prepare, attend 
and participate in the Board and applicable committee meetings. 
Each member is expected to ensure their other commitments 
do not materially interfere with their responsibilities 
towards the Company.
Meeting of independent directors
For the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters 
related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board, 
it is important for the independent directors to have meetings 
without the presence of the executive management.
Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder 
mandate that the independent directors of the Company 
shall hold at least one meeting in a financial year, without the 
attendance of non-independent directors and members of 
the Management. Even before the Companies Act, 2013 came 
into effect, our Board’s process mandated periodic meetings 
attended exclusively by the independent directors. 
During the year, the independent directors met four times 
without the presence of executive directors and management. 
At such meetings, the independent directors discuss, among 
other matters, the performance of the Company and risks faced 
by it, the flow of information to the Board, competition, strategy, 
leadership strengths and weaknesses, governance, compliance, 
Board movements, succession planning, human resources 
matters and the performance of the executive members of the 
Board, committees and the Chairman.
is chosen as the chairperson of the committee. The Company 
also has a Cybersecurity Risk Sub-committee under the Risk 
Management Committee. The Sub-committee comprises only 
independent directors.

Responsible leadership
Leading by example is a key tenet of corporate governance at Infosys.  
Both the Board and the Management work together to set the highest 
standards of responsible leadership.
Responsibilities of the Board leadership
We believe that an active, well-informed, diversified and 
independent board is necessary to ensure the highest standards 
of corporate governance. At Infosys, the Board is at the core 
of our corporate governance practice. The Board oversees the 
Management’s functions and protects the long-term interests 
of our stakeholders. 
The responsibilities and authority of the Chairman, the CEO & MD 
and the lead independent director are as follows:
Chairman
The Company has separated the roles of Chairman and the CEO 
& MD to create a more balanced governance structure. The 
Chairman leads the Board and is responsible for fostering and 
promoting the integrity of the Board while nurturing a culture in 
which the Board works harmoniously for the long-term benefit 
of the Company and all its stakeholders. He presides over all 
meetings of the Board and of the shareholders of the Company.
The Chairman takes a lead role in managing the Board and 
facilitates effective communication among directors. He is 
responsible for overseeing matters pertaining to governance, 
including the organization, composition and effectiveness 
of the Board and its committees, and the performance of 
individual directors. 
The Chairman actively works with the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee to plan the composition of the 
Board and Board committees, induct directors to the Board, 
plan for director succession, participate effectively in the Board 
evaluation process and meet with individual directors to provide 
constructive feedback and advice.
CEO & MD
The CEO & MD is responsible for executing corporate strategy 
in consultation with the Board, as well as for brand equity, 
planning, building external contacts and all matters related 
to the management of the Company. He is responsible for 
achieving annual and long-term business targets. The CEO 
& MD also monitors the external and internal competitive 
landscape, and new industry developments and standards, 
identifies opportunities for expansion and acquisition, and 
builds relationships with customers and markets to enhance 
shareholder value and implement the organization’s vision, 
mission, and overall direction.
The CEO & MD acts as a link between the Board and the 
Management and is also responsible for leading and evaluating 
the work of other executive leaders.
Lead Independent Director
The lead independent director was appointed by the Board 
to ensure robust independent leadership of the Board. The 
general authority and responsibilities of the lead independent 
director are decided by the group of independent directors. The 
lead independent director also performs additional duties as 
determined by the Board.
The lead independent director provides leadership to the 
independent directors, liaises on behalf of the independent 
directors and ensures the Board’s effectiveness in maintaining 
high-quality governance of the organization and effective 
functioning of the Board.

to the specific theme.

closely with the senior leadership of the Company and get a

Fairness and excellence
Two of the core values of our C-LIFE, fairness and excellence are evident 
in the workings of the Board, its evaluation and the compensation paid to 
the directors and the executive leadership.
Board member evaluation
One of the key functions of the Board is to monitor and review 
the Board evaluation framework. The Board works with the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee to lay down the 
evaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the 
Board, Board committees, and executive / non-executive / 
independent directors through peer evaluation, excluding the 
director being evaluated.
Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control 
and guidance. Some performance indicators, based on which the 
independent directors are evaluated, include:
•	
The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate 
governance practices
•	
The ability to contribute by introducing international best 
practices to address business challenges and risks
•	
Active participation in long-term strategic planning
•	
Commitment to the fulfilment of a director’s obligations and 
fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board 
and committee meetings.
To improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, 
as well as that of each individual director, a formal and rigorous 
Board review is undertaken on an annual basis. 
The Board had engaged Egon Zehnder, a leadership advisory 
firm on board matters, to conduct the Board evaluation for fiscal 
2025. The evaluation process focused on Board dynamics, softer 
aspects, committee effectiveness and information flow to the 
Board or its committees, among other matters. The methodology 
included various techniques such as questionnaires, one-on-
one discussions, etc. The aspects of succession planning and 
committee composition were also considered. The Board 
evaluation process was completed during fiscal 2025. During 
the year, the recommendations of the previous year’s Board 
evaluation were discussed with the Board and individual 
feedback was provided. Progress on recommendations from last 
year and the current year’s recommendations were discussed. 
Further, the evaluation process was based on the affirmation 
received from the independent directors that they met the 
independence criteria as required under the Companies Act 2013, 
the Listing Regulations and the NYSE listing manual.
Board and executive leadership compensation
Executive leadership compensation
Our executive compensation programs encourage reward 
for performance. A significant portion of the executives’ 
total rewards is tied to the delivery of long-term corporate 
performance goals to align with the interests of the shareholders.
As required under the Listing Regulations, the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the

Integrity and transparency & Relationship with stakeholders
Our Company upholds integrity and transparency in all transactions and 
communications with stakeholders. Our stakeholders are our partners in our journey 
to sustained value creation and therefore, our relationship with stakeholders and 
clear communication with them is at the center of all disclosures and reports. 
Corporate
Infosys was incorporated in Pune, in 1981, as Infosys Consultants 
Private Limited, a private limited company under the Companies 
Act, 1956. In 1983, the corporate headquarters were relocated 
to Bengaluru. The name of the Company was changed to 
Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys 
Technologies Limited in June 1992, when the Company became a 
public limited company. We made an Initial Public Offering (IPO) 
in February 1993 and were listed on stock exchanges in India in 
June 1993. Trading opened at ₹145 per share, compared to the 
IPO price of ₹95 per share. In October 1994, we made a private 
placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹450 each to Foreign Institutional 
Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and body corporates.
On March 11, 1999, Infosys listed on NASDAQ, becoming the 
first Indian company to do so. We issued 20,70,000 American 
Depositary Shares (ADSs) (equivalent to 10,35,000 equity shares 
of par value ₹10 each) at US$34 per ADS under the ADS Program, 
and these ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ National Market.
The share data mentioned before is unadjusted for stock split 
and bonus shares. In July 2003, June 2005 and November 
2006, we issued secondary-sponsored American Depositary 
Receipts (ADRs) of US$294 million, US$1.1 billion and US$1.6 
billion, respectively.
During fiscal 2012, the name of the Company was changed 
from Infosys Technologies Limited to Infosys Limited to mark 
the transition from being a technology services provider to a 
business transformation partner to our clients.
During fiscal 2013, we delisted our ADSs from NASDAQ, and listed 
them in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext London 
and Euronext Paris. During fiscal 2019, the Company voluntarily 
delisted from Euronext London and Paris due to low trading 
volume. Infosys equity shares and ADSs are listed on NSE and BSE 
in India and in NYSE, respectively, under the symbol “INFY”.

of 2:1. For example, if the investor / shareholder held one share in 1986 prior to the bonus issue and continued to hold it, he would have 16,384 shares today owing 
to the bonus share issues and stock split.

Investor awareness
We have provided a synopsis of the rights and responsibilities 
of shareholders on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/
investors/shareholder-services/pages/faqs.aspx.
Share transfer system
SEBI, effective April 01, 2019, barred physical transfer of shares of 
listed companies and mandated transfers only through demat. 
However, investors are not barred from holding shares in physical

financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are 
material. Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings and exercise their own 
judgment in assessing risks associated with the Company.
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables 
the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives by 
identifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring, and 
governing any risk or potential threat to these objectives. While 
this is the key driver, our values, culture, and commitment to 
stakeholders – employees, customers, investors, regulatory 
bodies, partners, and the community around us – are the 
foundation for our ERM framework. The systematic and proactive 
identification of risks, and mitigation thereof, enables our 
organization to boost performance with effective and timely 
decision-making. Strategic decisions are taken after careful 
consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential 
risks, and residual risks. The ERM function also enables effective 
resource allocation through structured qualitative and 
quantitative risk impact assessment and prioritization based on 
our risk appetite, which is defined through the ERM framework. 
During the assessment, impacts and likelihood or probability 
of the risks are assessed using a four-point scale, and risks are 
categorized into four groups based on this. Our ERM framework 
also enables the identification of underlying opportunities 
during risk assessment, which are then further evaluated and 
actionized by the business. Our ERM framework encompasses 
all of the Company’s risks – strategy and strategy execution; 
operational; legal and compliance risks. Any of these categories 
can have internal or external dimensions. Hence, appropriate risk 
indicators are used to identify these risks proactively. We take 
cognizance of risks emanating internally or externally and their 
cumulative impact while framing our risk responses. 
Emerging risks: Our ERM framework has defined a process to 
identify, assess, plan, and monitor risks emerging from internal 
and external environment which enables the Company to build 
and maintain resilience in uncertain times. The process includes 
horizon scanning and SWOT analysis, which cover political, 
economic, social, technology, legal and environmental aspects. 
The emerging risks are monitored constantly and discussed 
in the risk councils and with the Risk Management Committee 
(RMC) of the Board on a periodic basis.
Strategy and strategy execution
The risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the 
successful execution of our strategy are covered in this category. For example, risks inherent to our 
industry and our competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices of target 
markets, our market offerings, business model and talent base.
Operational
The risks affecting our policies, procedures, people and systems, thereby impacting service delivery 
or operations, or compromising our core values or business practices are covered in this category. For 
example, risks such as inefficiencies in internal processes, human rights, fraud risks, business activity 
disruptions due to natural calamities, climate change events, human conflicts, system failures and 
cybersecurity attacks.
Legal and compliance
The risks arising out of threats posed to our financial, organizational, or reputational standing 
resulting from litigations, non-conformance with laws, regulatory or geo-political developments, 
codes of conduct and contractual compliances are covered in this category.
Integrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework
We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our 
ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique 
business requirements.

GOVERNANCE
Risk management at Infosys encompasses all areas, including 
first, second, and third lines of defence. Risk management 
is embedded into the core business process and day-to-day 
decision making of every function within the Company and 
forms an integral part of the development process and project 
execution. Risk management has been ingrained into the job 
description of senior management, middle management, and 
people who front-end the customer work. Achieving strategic 
goals by proactively managing the risks is the responsibility of 
the Company’s management at all levels. Financial incentives are 
linked to the achievement of strategic goals. As the first line of 
defence, they evaluate risks and opportunities before taking key 
business decisions. This first line works closely with corporate 
ERM through risk councils and sub-risk councils created across 
the organization in different units.
The second line of defence consists of various risk functions such 
as Information Security Group (ISG), Data Privacy Office (DPO), 
Quality, Delivery Risk Management (DRM), Business Continuity, 
Legal, Compliance, etc., who work very closely with ERM function 
in identifying, assessing, reporting and governing the risks. While 
risks are largely mitigated by the first line / business, they are 
tracked and governed by the second line. These are reported 
to the executive leadership through various councils, including 
the Operational Risk Council (ORC) and the Legal & Compliance 
Risk Council (LCRC). These key risks are also presented to the Risk 
Management Committee (RMC) of the Board on a quarterly basis.
The third line of defence encompasses an internal audit that 
reviews various risks and controls on a periodic basis to assess 
the effectiveness of the risk management process and report 
independently. Inputs on key risks by the ERM are considered 
while drafting the audit plan. The Company maintains a single 
hierarchical risks repository from L1 to L5, covering strategic 
to tactical risks. All these are governed by the integrated ERM 
framework of the Company. This is how all lines of defence are 
aligned as depicted in the ERM framework above.
The Company also conducts maturity assessment of the ERM 
process on a periodic basis by an independent external agency. 
The recent maturity assessment was conducted in March 2024.
Risk management is ingrained in all parts of the organization. 
Risk-enabled decision-making and forums at various levels of 
the organization to enhance risk-related decisions to identify 
and mitigate the risks are the hallmarks of a good risk culture. At 
Infosys, this is enabled through the implementation of integrated 
Enterprise Risk Management, and this function acts as a decision 
support system for the executive leadership. A multi-layered 
governance structure provides open forums for risk discussions 
at various levels. Comprehensive awareness and training 
programs are conducted on a regular basis for all the employees 
and contractors to cover risks applicable to the business. Lex, 
our in-house learning platform, offers various risk management 
courses which are accessible from anywhere in the world. 
Periodic table-top exercises are conducted in key areas to review 
preparedness for high impact-low probability risks.

Salient features of our Enterprise Risk Management program
Our ERM program adopts unique methods to identify risks, evaluate potential impact and promote risk awareness across the organization.
Secondary, consequential and residual risks
Secondary risks are threats that could impede the mitigation 
of primary risks. Consequential risks are the unintended 
consequences of primary mitigation, and residual risks are 
those risks that are left over after mitigation.
Process risk frameworks
Aggregation and accumulation
Exposure for same risks are aggregated as it goes up the 
hierarchy. This provides enterprise-wide view
to the leadership. Cumulated risk view is also provided to 
understand total exposure arising out of all risks at a unit level.
Process-speciﬁc risk frameworks have been 
developed for decision-making,
for example, frameworks for customer risk, 
vendor risk, contractual liability, contractual 
weighted risk and credit risk.
Intelligent risk analytics
Internal and external risk and performance indicators, 
and loss incidents are used in real time to identify, 
analyze and assess potential issues that could negatively 
impact strategic goals.
RISC360 : iGRC
Risk culture
RISC360 is the Company’s Governance, Risk management and 
Compliance (GRC) program that combines three lines of defense 
under one umbrella. This enables risk-based decision-making and 
auditing. The Company has implemented a technology platform, 
iGRC, to provide a consolidated view of risks to strategic goals.
Our risk culture encourages open and upward communication. 
Coupled with our belief systems and core values, this drives 
behavior, guides daily activities and decision-making throughout 
the organization. We encourage sharing of knowledge and best 
practices, continuous process improvement and a strong 
commitment to ethics and integrity.

Highlights of fiscal 2025
During fiscal 2025, various risks management initiatives were 
undertaken so as to ensure the smooth delivery of services to 
our clients, transparent communication with all stakeholders, 
fulfilment of our social responsibility while ensuring employee 
safety and health by strengthening risk management program 
and enhancing the risk culture. The risk office assessed, 
monitored and reported on risks related to geo-political 
scenarios; uncertainties in the economy; inflation; technology 
disruption and innovation; talent availability; cybersecurity; data 
protection and privacy; ESG; contractual liabilities; and complex 
and evolving regulatory environment.
While the Company tracks several risks to its business, the key 
risks and emerging risks are described below along with the 
Company’s approach to mitigate them.
Key / Emerging risks
Impact on Company
Mitigation / Opportunity
Geo-political, 
macroeconomic or 
health events 
•	
Our revenues are concentrated in a few geographies 
and client industries, and a large part of our revenue is 
dependent on a limited number of clients. Unfavorable 
geo-political, economic, or health events may result in 
currency volatility and reduced spend on technology 
products and services which may adversely impact 
demand for our offerings which in turn may impact 
our growth and profitability.
•	
Emerging risk aspect: Geo-political, economic or 
health events are dynamic in nature and constantly 
evolving. Uncertainty and unpredictability of policy 
changes by governments such as tariffs, trade 
restrictions etc., sometimes make it difficult to predict 
and assess the impact.
•

Cybersecurity risk management
Cyber risks, being one of the key risks, is managed through 
multi-layered controls with a defence-in-depth approach 
starting from the cybersecurity strategy, supplemented by 
policies, processes and controls (preventive, detective, and 
corrective). Our strategy is focused on four areas: transparency 
and experience; continual improvement and compliance; cyber 
resilience; and building and maintaining a positive cybersecurity 
culture within the organization. A high-level working group, 
the enterprise Information Security Council (ISC), has been 
established, which is responsible for governing and overseeing 
the Information Security Management System (ISMS) at Infosys. 
ISC focuses on establishing, directing, monitoring, and executing 
the information security program with representation from 
various departments and business units at Infosys and reports 
to the Operational Risk Council highlighting key risks to the 
executive leadership.

A reasonable assurance engagement involves identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified 
Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes performed, 
inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and 
agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we: 
•	 Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures;
•	 Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements of the Identified 
Sustainability Information;
•	 Made inquiries of Company’s management, including environment team, compliance team, human resource team amongst others 
and those with the responsibility for preparation of the Report;
•	 Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes and controls for recording, 
processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information at the corporate office and at other locations/offices on 
a sample basis. This included evaluating the design of those controls relevant to the engagement and determining whether 
they have been implemented by performing procedures in addition to inquiry of the personnel responsible for the Identified 
Sustainability Information;
•	 Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially misstated, 
determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures;
•	 Tested the key assumptions, emission factors and methodologies used for calculation of the Greenhouse Gas (the “GHG”) emissions;
•	 Tested the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the identified 
sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis; and 
•	 Tested the consolidation for locations/offices on a sample basis and corporate office under the reporting boundary for ensuring the 
completeness of data being reported.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.
9.	 Exclusions 
Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on: 
•	 Aspects of the Report and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability Information; 
and
•	 The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided by the

Infosys has always placed sustainability at the heart of its

responsibilities to our stakeholders is a testament to our 
commitment. We have balanced our business success with an 
unwavering focus on exemplary corporate governance and 
responsiveness to the needs of the environment and society. 
As an early proponent of responsible business, we readily 
embraced our commitment to integrate Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) factors into our operations. 
We adopted the GRI Framework in 2008 and in fiscal 2013, 
we were among the first companies to publish the Business 
Responsibility Report (BRR). 
The BRSR follows the National Guidelines on Responsible 
Business Conduct (NGRBC) principles on the social, 
environmental and economic responsibilities of business. 
Our BRSR includes our responses to questions about our 
practices and performance on key principles defined by 
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations 2015 as amended from time to time, 
which cover topics across all ESG dimensions.

10. Health and safety management system:
10a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes / No). If yes, the coverage of such system?
Yes. Infosys recognizes and accords highest priority to safety and well-being of its employees and other relevant parties. Our HSE Policy enunciates our philosophy and 
commitment towards the management of key Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) aspects. In line with our strategy, our Health, Safety and Environmental Management System 
(HSEMS) at all India locations is certified to ISO 45001:2018 standard. HSEMS is implemented at all our overseas locations based on legal requirements / internal benchmarks and 
have also included them in the internal audits cycle. We have established numerous interventions to address occupational health-related topics such as emotional well-being, 
mental health, ergonomics, safety, lifestyle diseases and more. Well-equipped occupational health centers are available at all our campuses in India. During the year, doctors and 
physiotherapists have helped employees and their families through virtual consultations leveraging our telemedicine portal. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are 
available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html.
10b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?
We proactively identify occupational health and safety risks, for all existing / new / modified activities, processes, products or services, and regulatory changes, including routine 
and non-routine activities. Risk assessment includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous conditions, if any, are identified and prioritized for elimination 
and control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks. As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are no 
product risks, but there are risks associated with the provision of services such as ergonomics at work and those associated with the operation of utilities and employees’ commute. 
Participation and consultation with relevant personnel involved in the activities is ensured during the risk assessments. Risks are also assessed before and after the development 
of new buildings. Experience from previous projects and ongoing operations is also considered. We continually monitor our construction sites where infrastructure is being built. 
More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-
health-safety.html.
10c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y / N)
Yes. We have a process for employees and ‘other than permanent’ employees to report work-related hazards.
10d. Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
Yes

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.
Infosys acknowledges that Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) is one of the key aspects of sustainable business practices. OH&S policies, processes, and practices at 
Infosys promote the physical, emotional, and social well-being of employees in the workplace. The robust Health and Safety Management system at Infosys has earned us 
the certification of ISO 45001:2018 for all Indian locations, including Infosys Limited and its subsidiaries, in line with our HSE strategy.
The Company has implemented the following measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace:
1.	 Incident management: Incidents, which include near misses / potential hazards / accidents, are reported through internal applications or email. The causes of incidents 
are identified, analyzed and appropriate corrective actions are taken to prevent recurrence or occurrence of incidents leading to injuries / losses.
2.	 OH&S Committee: Both employees and contract workers are part of the Infosys OH&S Committee, which helps in ensuring their active participation and consultation. 
3.	 Training and awareness: Training includes awareness building, mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic demonstrations. HSEMS training is a part of our employee 
induction program. To enable continuous learning, an HSE awareness module is available on Lex, our internal learning platform. For contract staff, job-specific and 
general training is provided during induction and later through refresher training.
4.	 Safety interventions: We have always focused on building a culture of safety at Infosys. The safety systems in place include work permits, trainings, Lock Out Tag 
Out (LOTO), safety inspections, audits, operational controls, and monitoring. Policies have been established focusing on specific areas such as women’s safety, lone 
working, transport, travel, construction and others.
5.	 Medical services: We have set up first aid centers on our campuses in India. Some of the first aid facilities are operational round the clock. Our telemedicine portal 
continues to operate and allows our employees to consult the doctors at our occupational health centers in India online. We have ambulance services available or have 
arrangements for ambulances to be made available at all our India-based locations. 
6.	 Health Risk Assessment (HRA): HRA is conducted annually based on inputs from the OHC. Being an IT / ITES company, the prevalent risks include ergonomics, 
Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), emotional well-being, etc., associated with the workplace, operation of utilities, and commute. Numerous initiatives, interventions, 
engagement virtual sessions, and process controls are in place to address these risks.

8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing greenhouse gas emission? If yes, provide details.
Infosys has been carbon neutral since fiscal 2020 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our approach to carbon neutrality is based on reducing and avoiding emissions through energy 
efficiency and renewable energy. Energy efficiency is achieved through super-efficient new buildings, industry-leading Energy Performance Index (EPI) <65 kWh/m2-yr, real-time
monitoring and optimization of building operations through smart building systems, and retrofits in existing buildings. Infosys has implemented several retrofit projects (across air 
conditioning, lighting, and UPS systems) in the past and achieved a connected electrical load reduction of 36 MW across campuses in India. In 2025, we have undertaken a retrofit 
project to replace direct FCU units with chilled water units of air conditioning, which saved 1.3 lakh kWh and reduced emissions by 94.72 tCO2e. To achieve our goal of transitioning 
to clean energy, we have installed 60 MW of solar PV capacity.

10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and 
toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.
The 5R principle –’ Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish / Repurpose and Recycle’ – forms the foundation of Infosys’ waste management strategy. Through our efforts, we turn waste 
into resources and thus support a circular economy. Infosys has adopted a comprehensive waste management practice which involves collection, sorting and disposal of waste. 
Waste management practices at Infosys include source segregation, secondary segregation, effective waste processing and collection, recycling and efficient disposal of all waste in 
accordance with relevant laws. This helps reduce negative impacts on the environment.
We seek to uphold our ambition of ‘zero waste to landfill’ through active minimization combined with technological investment in recycling and streamlining of systems and 
processes. Infosys is pursuing the goal of zero waste to landfill at all of its own sites by 2030, utilizing the TRUE Certification for Zero Waste, provided by Green Business Certification 
Inc. TRUE Certification requires a facility to divert at least 90% of its waste from landfill, incineration (waste-to-energy), and the environment. Using TRUE’s portfolio approach, 
Infosys has earned TRUE Certification for three campuses last year, and is committed to achieving certification for seven of its owned campuses in fiscal 2026 and subsequently will 
embark on the certification for the rest of the owned locations.
The e-waste is disposed to authorized refurbishers, recyclers who issue us certificates for successful recycling and recovery of the material. These are established with a focus on 
adhering to principles of circularity. Other hazardous waste such as biomedical waste, oil-soaked cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other trash are designated by the Central 
Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). These agencies incinerate the waste in compliance with the rules and regulations. The resulting ash is 
used in some places for the manufacture of cement and is sent for Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) landfills for safe disposal.

expectations. The BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and continually 
improving business continuity measures across Infosys and its subsidiaries. Apart from Phoenix plan at the corporate level, comprehensive business continuity plans are 
created at three operational levels covering business functions, locations, and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the BCMS plans guide 
our typical response to events, such as catastrophes and natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations. This covers various 
crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments (at functions, locations, and accounts level), which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in 
place. The management system has been continuously validated across levels through tests and exercises, and various incidents have been successfully tackled without 
significant business continuity or employee safety impacts. An efficient business continuity management policy has enabled us to maintain status quo during disasters.

Independent Auditor’s Report
To The Members Of Infosys Limited
Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”), which comprise the 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes 
in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of 
material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Standalone Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial 
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the indian accounting standards prescribed under section 133 of the act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in india, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025 and its profit, total comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under 
section 143(10) of the act. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit 
of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the act and the rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained 
by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial 
statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as 
a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matter
1
Revenue recognition
The Company’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The Company derives 
revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package 
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings and business 
process management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance 
obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of 
the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.
In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor 
equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is 
recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when 
the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the 
specified goods or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible 
for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to 
determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed 
through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method 
when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is 
not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of 
method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature 
of the deliverables.
As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) 
determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is 
recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments 
were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.
Refer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.
Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:
Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the 
Company is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line 
basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:
•	
We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) 
determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price 
maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion 
method.
•	
We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:
	– Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents 
that were part of the agreement.
	– Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) 
identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) 
whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion 
method.

Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through 
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through 
the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, 
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method.
Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended 
to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to 
measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total 
efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes 
based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the 
period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of 
completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and 
is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This 
estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred 
to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the 
term of the contracts.
This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to 
evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.
Refer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.
 
Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:
Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the 
following, among others:
•	
We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts 
or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls 
pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of 
efforts incurred.
•	
We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured the using percentage-of-completion method and 
performed the following:
	– Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation 
by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance 
obligations that have been fulfilled.
	– Compared efforts or costs incurred with Company’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant 
variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs 
or efforts to complete the contract.
	– Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off 
from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts 
to complete the remaining performance obligations.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, 
Standalone Financial Statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Board of Directors for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of 
these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, including other 
comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
The Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company 
has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
214
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure “A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to the Members of 
Infosys Limited of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the 
“Company”) as of March 31, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company 
considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over 
Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial 
information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the 
Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper 
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the criteria for internal financial control 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

period of one year from the balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of

any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date, will get 
discharged by the Company as and when they fall due.

year, to a Special account within a period of 30 days from the end of the said financial year in compliance with the provision

Overview and Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
1. Overview
1.1 Company overview
Infosys Limited ("the Company" or Infosys) provides 
consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation 
digital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their 
digital transformation. Infosys' strategic objective is to build a 
sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of 
clients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and 
generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys' strategy is to 
be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on 
their journey to a digital future.
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics City, 
Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company 
has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock 
Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American Depositary 
Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The Standalone financial statements are approved for issue by the 
Company's Board of Directors on April 17, 2025.
1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements
These Standalone financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (''the Act''), 
guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (SEBI) and Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) under the 
historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain 
financial instruments which are measured at fair values, defined 
benefit liability / (asset) which is recognized at the present value 
of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. The Ind 
AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 
of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and 
relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where 
a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a 
revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in 
the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting 
policy information used in preparation of the audited condensed 
standalone interim financial statements have been discussed in 
the respective notes.
As the year to date figures are taken from the source and 
rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the 
previous quarters might not always add up to the year to date 
figures reported in this statement.
1.3 Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, 
judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and 
assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the period. The application of accounting policies 
that require critical accounting estimates involving complex 
and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in 
these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.4. 
Accounting estimates could change from period to period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate 
changes in estimates are made as management becomes aware 
of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes 
in estimates and judgements are reflected in the financial 
statements in the period in which changes are made and, if 
material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the Standalone 
financial statements.
1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
a. Revenue recognition 
The Company’s contracts with customers include promises to 
transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues 
from customer contracts are considered for recognition and 
measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, 
by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are 
committed to perform their respective obligations under the 
contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Company 
assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies 
distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of 
distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables 
and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from 
such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these 
distinct performance obligations involves significant judgement.
Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a 
straight-line basis when services are performed through an 
indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. 
Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized 
ratably using a percentage of completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer 
and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the 
period of the contract because the services are generally discrete 
in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the 
maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the 
promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.
The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method 
in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the 
percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to 
determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a 
proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. 
Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress 
towards completion as there is a direct relationship between 
input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs 
involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the 
period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest 
available information.
Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or 
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated 
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue

2. Notes to the Standalone financial statements
2.1 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting Policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly 
attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, 
plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the 
Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is 
derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected 
useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. 
The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over 
their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.
The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
Building(1)
22-25 years
Plant and machinery(1)
5 years
Office equipment
5 years
Computer equipment(1)
3-5 years
Furniture and fixtures(1)
5 years
Vehicles(1)
5 years
Leasehold improvements
Lower of useful life of the asset 
or lease term
(1)	 Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the 
useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the 
Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for 
these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of 
Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The 
useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets 
as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their 
life, such as changes in technology.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified 
as capital advances under other non-current assets and the 
cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed 
under ‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures 
relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated 
depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon 
sale or retirement of the asset.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined 
on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are largely independent of those from other 
assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for 
the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded 
net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between 
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company 
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company 
first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods 
or services before they are transferred to the customer. The 
Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for 
fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, 
inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine 
whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, 
is acting as a principal or an agent.
Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts 
are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable 
based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
b. Income taxes
The Company's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the 
United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other 
overseas jurisdictions.
Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision 
for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / 
recovered for uncertain tax positions.
In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the 
Management considers whether some portion or all of the 
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon 
the generation of future taxable income during the periods 
in which the temporary differences become deductible. The 
Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred 
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax 
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level 
of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable 
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax 
assets are deductible, management believes that the Company 
will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The 
amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, 
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of 
future taxable income during the carry forward period are 
reduced. Refer to Note 2.17
c. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion 
of the asset base of the Company. The charge in respect of 
periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate 
of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual 
value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values 
of Company's assets are determined by the Management 
at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, 
including at each financial year end. The lives are based on 
historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation 
of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in 
technology. Refer to Note 2.1

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to 
be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by 
the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the 
estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss 
is reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its 
revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 
(net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss 
been recognized for the asset in prior years.

Accounting policy
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective 
individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an 
identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other 
economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures 
required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically 
including at each financial year end.
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and 
commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability 
to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of 
material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

2.3 Leases 
Accounting policy
The Company as a lessee 
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for 
land, buildings and computers. The Company assesses whether 
a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses 
whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset 
(ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits 
from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the 
Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company 
recognizes a Right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease 
liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except 
for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) 
and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, 
the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
As a lessee, the Company determines the lease term as the non-
cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend 
or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably 
certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected 
lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses 
whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or 
terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease 
term, the Company considers factors such as any significant 
leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs 
relating to the termination of the lease and the importance 
of the underlying asset to Infosys’s operations taking into 
account the location of the underlying asset and the availability 
of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is 
reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current 
economic circumstances.
Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or 
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised.
The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the 
lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses.
The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and 
useful life of the underlying asset. The ROU assets are evaluated 
for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For 
the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. 
the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is 
determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from 
other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined 
for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

Net of adjustments on account of modifications and lease incentives
The aggregate depreciation expense on ROU assets is included under depreciation and amortization expense in the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the 
present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments 
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if 
not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates 
in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right 
of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it 
will exercise an extension or a termination option.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in 
the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.
The Company as a lessor 
Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance 
or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, 
the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.
When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for 
its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The 
sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference 
to the ROU asset arising from the head lease.
For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-
line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

2.11 Financial instruments 
Accounting policy
2.11.1 Initial recognition
The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities 
when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized 
at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables 
which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair 
value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial 
recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are 
accounted for at trade date.
2.11.2 Subsequent measurement
a. Non-derivative financial instruments
(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost
A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost 
if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold 
the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI)
A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash 
flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding. The Company has made an irrevocable election 
for its investments which are classified as equity instruments 
to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other 
comprehensive income based on its business model.
(iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL)
A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above 
categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.
(iv) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method, except for contingent 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
249
consideration recognized in a business combination which is 
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.
(v) Investment in subsidiaries
Investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate 
financial statements.
b. Derivative financial instruments
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the 
risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. 
The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.
(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value 
through profit or loss.
This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities 
which are not designated as hedges.
Although the Company believes that these derivatives 
constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may 
not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial 
Instruments. Any derivative that is either not designated as 
hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is 
categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value 
through profit or loss.
Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially 
at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized 
in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured 
at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange 
gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in 
this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities 
if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized 
within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.
(ii) Cash flow hedge
The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward 
and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate 
the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable 
forecast cash transactions.
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging 
instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of 
the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any ineffective 
portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized 
immediately in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. 
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the 
hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve 
until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is 
transferred to the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the 
forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the 
amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified 
to net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments
The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire 
or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for 
derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of 
a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's Balance 
Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged 
or cancelled or expires.
2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments
In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the 
Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are 
based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting 
date. The methods used to determine fair value include 
discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market 
multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All 
methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of 
value, and such value may never actually be realized.
Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the 
disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and 
liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one 
year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair 
value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the 
short maturity of these instruments.
2.11.5 Impairment 
The Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected 
credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled 
revenues which are not fair valued through profit or loss. 
Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues 
with no significant financing component is measured at an 
amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, 
expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to 
the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are 
measured at lifetime ECL.
The Company determines the allowance for credit losses 
based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current 
and estimated future economic conditions. The Company 
considers current and anticipated future economic conditions 
relating to industries the Company deals with and the 
countries where it operates.
The amount of ECLs (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss 
allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required 
to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, tax-free bonds and non-convertible debentures of ₹1,986 crore were transferred from Level 2 
to Level 1 of fair value hierarchy since these were valued based on quoted price. Further, State government securities of ₹73 crore were 
transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on market observable inputs
A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have a 
significant impact in its value.
Majority of investments of the Company are fair valued based 
on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily 
include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity 
fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial 
papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible 
debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi-
government organizations. The Company invests after 
considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria 
including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, 
Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial 
institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group's 
risk management program.
Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial 
risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's 
primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its 
financial performance. The primary market risk to the Company 
is foreign exchange risk. The Company uses derivative financial 
instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. 
The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the 
individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration 
of risk from the top few customers.
Market risk
The Company operates internationally and a major portion of 
the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently 
the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through 
its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and 
purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. 
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the 
risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. 
The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign 
currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may 
fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of 
the Company’s operations are adversely affected as the rupee 
appreciates / depreciates against these currencies.

of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank. These derivative 
financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or 
indirectly observable in the marketplace.

During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 the 
Company has designated certain foreign exchange forward 
and option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk 
of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast 
cash transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance 
in cash flow hedge reserve as at March 31, 2025 are expected 
to occur and reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss 
within three months.
The Company determines the existence of an economic 
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item 
based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted 
cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception 
of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective 
effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic 
relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging 
instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is 
expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer 
optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged 
and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the 
hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the 
volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged 
item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk 
management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated 
and accounted for in the Statement of Profit or Loss at the time of 
the hedge relationship rebalancing.
The reconciliation of cash flow hedge reserve for the year ended 
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is as follows:

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by 
the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily 
from trade receivables amounting to ₹26,437 crore and ₹25,152 
crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively and 
unbilled revenue amounting to ₹11,988 crore and ₹10,814 crore 
as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Trade 
receivables and unbilled revenue are typically unsecured and 
are derived from revenue from customers majorly located in the 
United States of America and Europe. Credit risk has always been 
managed by the Company through credit approvals, establishing 
credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness 
of the customers to which the Company grants credit terms in 
the normal course of business. The Company uses the expected 
credit loss model to assess any required allowances; and uses a 
provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance 
for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This matrix takes into 
account credit reports and other related credit information to 
the extent available.
The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the 
individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration 
of risk from the top few customers. Exposure to customers is 
diversified and there is no single customer contributing more 
than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and unbilled revenues.
The following table gives details in respect of percentage 
of revenues generated from top five customers 
and top ten customers:

institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group’s 
risk management program.

As at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 2,88,384 and 2,91,795 cash-settled options were outstanding respectively. The carrying value of 
liability towards cash-settled share-based payments was ₹8 crore and ₹13 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 respectively.
The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and 
Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options.
The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected 
term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of 
the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the 
options. Expected volatility of the comparative company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of 
their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated 
between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.
The fair value of each equity-settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

2.16 Provisions
Accounting policy
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the 
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an 
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the liability. The Company recognizes 
a reimbursement asset when, and only when, it is virtually 
certain that the reimbursement will be received if the Company 
settles the obligation.
a. Post-sales client support
The Company provides its clients with a fixed-period post-sales 
support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs 
associated with such support services are accrued at the time 
related revenues are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
The Company estimates such costs based on historical experience 
and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material 
changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.
b. Onerous contracts
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future 
obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, 
if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in 
which such losses become probable based on the estimated 
efforts or costs to complete the contract. The provision is 
measured at the present value of the lower of the expected 
cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of 
continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, 
the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets 
associated with that contract.

2.17 Income taxes
Accounting policy
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. 
Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in 
equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for 
current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected 
to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the 
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax 
assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to 
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences 
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes 
in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is 
recognized as income or expense in the period that includes 
the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred 
income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. 
Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed 
earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that 
the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in 
the foreseeable future.
The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a 
legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts 
and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The income 
tax provision for the interim period is made based on the best 
estimate of the annual average tax rate expected to be applicable 
for the full financial year. Tax benefits of deductions earned on 
exercise of employee share options in excess of compensation 
charged to income are credited to equity.

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the 
year ended March 31, 2025 is 25.17% and for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 is 34.94%.
Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 
March 31, 2024 includes provisions (net of reversals) of ₹97 crore 
and reversals (net of provisions) of ₹913 crore, respectively. 
These provisions and reversals pertaining to prior periods are 
primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, 
upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across 
various jurisdictions.
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company received 
orders under Section 250 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, from the 
Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2016-17 
and 2019-20. These orders confirmed the Company's position 
with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a 
result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹327 crore was recognised and 
provision for income tax aggregating ₹183 crore was reversed 
with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to 
₹1,068 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received 
orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, 
from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment 
years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders 
confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment 
of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pre-
tax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognised and provision for income 
tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding 
credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution 
of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been 
reduced from contingent liabilities.
The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable overseas, 
principally in the United States.
In India, the Company has benefited from certain income tax 
incentives that the Government of India had provided for export 
of software and services from the units registered under the 
Special Economic Zones Act (SEZs), 2005 in the prior years. SEZ 
units which began the provision of services on or after April 
1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains 
derived from the export of services for the first five years from 
the financial year in which the unit commenced the provision of 
services and 50% of such profits or gains for further five years. 
Up to 50% of such profits or gains is also available for a further 
five years subject to creation of a Special Economic Zone re-
investment Reserve out of the profit for the eligible SEZ units 
and utilization of such reserve by the Company for acquiring new 
plant and machinery for the purpose of its business as per the 
provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (Refer to Special Economic 
Zone Re-investment reserve under Note 2.12 Equity).
Deferred income tax for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 
March 31, 2024 substantially relates to origination and reversal of 
temporary differences.
Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to 
the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater 
than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the 
year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. 
As at March 31, 2025, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to 
approximately ₹7,755 crore. As at March 31, 2025, the Company 
has a deferred tax liability for branch profit tax of ₹271 crore (net 
of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits 
are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on 
temporary differences amounting to ₹16,593 crore and ₹10,776 
crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively, 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches as 
the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The 
Company majorly intends to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries 
and branches only to the extent these can be distributed 
in a tax-free manner.
Deferred income tax assets have not been recognized on 
accumulated losses of ₹1,466 crore and ₹1,358 crore as at March 
31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively as it is probable that 
future taxable profit will not be available against which the 
unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future. 
Majority of the accumulated losses as at March 31, 2025 will expire 
between financial years 2028 to 2030.

In assessing the reliazibility of deferred income tax assets, the 
Management considers whether some portion or all of the 
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon 
the generation of future taxable income during the periods 
in which the temporary differences become deductible. The 
Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred 
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax 
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level 
of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable 
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets 
are deductible, management believes that the Company will 
realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount 
of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, 
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable 
income during the carry forward period are reduced.
The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired 
in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and 
currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best 
estimate determined based on the expected value method.
2.18 Revenue from operations
Accounting policy
The Company derives revenues primarily from IT services 
comprising software development and related services, cloud 
and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package 
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms 
across the Company’s core and digital offerings (together called 
as “software-related services”). Contracts with customers are 
either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a 
fixed-timeframe basis.
Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition 
and measurement when the contract has been approved in 
writing, by the parties, to the contract, the parties to contract 
are committed to perform their respective obligations under 
the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue 
is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products 
or services (“performance obligations”) to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration the Company has 
received or expects to receive in exchange for these products 
or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as 
to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such 
uncertainty is resolved.
The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and 
identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. 
The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling 
price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when 
sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling 
price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method 
used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost 
plus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost 
of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an 
appropriate margin based on similar services.
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
269
The Company’s contracts may include variable consideration 
including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Company 
includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when 
there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable 
consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal 
of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the 
uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.
Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts, 
are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-
line basis when services are performed through an indefinite 
number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using 
a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits 
from the services rendered to the customer and Company’s costs 
to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract 
because the services are generally discrete in nature and not 
repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe 
contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over 
time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. 
Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress 
towards completion as there is a direct relationship between 
input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured 
as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work 
performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates 
of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously 
monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in 
net profit in the period when these estimates change or when 
the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total 
costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. 
Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts 
are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable 
based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic 
performance-based billing and / or milestone based progress 
billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled 
revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as 
contract liabilities (which we refer to as "unearned revenues").
In arrangements for software development and related 
services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue 
recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, 
the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria 
for considering software development and related services as 
distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction 
price, the Company measures the revenue in respect of each 
performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone 
selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when 
sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling 
price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the 
standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost 
plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling 
price. For software development and related services, the 
performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services 
are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the 
work as it progresses.
Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include 
multiple elements which may be subject to other specific 
accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts 
are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting 
guidance. In such arrangements where the Company is able to 
determine that hardware and services are distinct performance 
obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance 
obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In 
the absence of standalone selling price, the Company uses 
the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the 
standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered 
as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over 
the period and measure of progress is determined based on 
promise in the contract.
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right 
to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license 
is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses 
where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized 
over the access period.
Arrangements to deliver software products generally have 
three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical 
Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in 
conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and 
implementation have been identified as two distinct separate 
performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts 
are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract 
based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence 
of standalone selling price for implementation, the Company 
uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the 
standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be 
substantially customized as part of the implementation service 
the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation 
is considered to be a single performance obligation and the 
revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion 
method as the implementation is performed. Revenue from client 
training, support and other services arising due to the sale of 
software products is recognized as the performance obligations 
are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line 
basis over the period in which the services are rendered.
Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or 
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated 
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue 
from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded 
net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between 
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company 
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company 
first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods 
or services before they are transferred to the customer. The 
Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for 
fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, 
inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine 
whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, 
is acting as a principal or an agent.
A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both 
of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. 
A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct 
performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate 
contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone 
selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and 
creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone 
selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
270
performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing 
contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs 
that would not have been incurred if the contract had not 
been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Company 
expects to recover them.
Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition 
or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate 
performance obligation are recognized as an asset when 
such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate 
or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in 
satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are 
expected to be recovered.
Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to 
customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs 
are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life 
on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or 
services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs 
are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are 
recorded when present value of projected remaining operating 
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of 
the capitalized costs.
The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its 
Statement of Profit and Loss.
Revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2025 and

The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and 
platforms including Infosys Applied AI which applies next-
generation AI and machine learning.
The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for 
the Year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is 58% 
and 56%, respectively.
Trade receivables and Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections 
results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue 
on the Company’s Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work 
progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, 
either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon 
achievement of contractual milestones.
The Company’s receivables are rights to consideration that 
are unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in 
excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed-
price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset 
when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only 
after a passage of time.
Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on 
milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of 
revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to 
the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed-price 
contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset 
because the right to consideration is dependent on completion 
of contractual milestones.
Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of 
impairment in the Balance Sheet.
During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 , the 
Company recognized revenue of ₹4,404 crore and ₹4,189 crore 
arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2024 and 
April 1, 2023 respectively.
During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 
₹4,448 crore and ₹6,396 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining 
to other fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts as 
of April 1, 2024 and April 1, 2023, respectively has been 
reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on 
completion of milestones.
Remaining performance obligation disclosure
The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the 
aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized 
as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as 
to when the Company expects to recognize these amounts in 
revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 
115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining performance 
obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue 
recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer 
of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those 
contracts where invoicing is on time-and-material and unit 
of work-based contracts. Remaining performance obligation 
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several 
factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, 
periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not 
materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations.
The aggregate value of performance obligations that are 
completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2025, other 
than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is 
₹90,815 crore. Out of this, the Company expects to recognize 
revenue of around 50.9% within the next one year and around 
20.4% between one and two years and remaining thereafter. The 
aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely 
or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2024 is ₹80,334 crore. 
The contracts can generally be terminated by the customers 
and typically includes an enforceable termination penalty 
payable by them. Generally, customers have not terminated 
contracts without cause.

2.19 Other income, net
2.19.1 Other income
Accounting policy
Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend 
income, gain / loss on investments and exchange gain / loss 
on forward and options contracts and on translation of foreign 
currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using 
the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized 
when the right to receive payment is established.
2.19.2 Foreign currency
Accounting policy
Functional currency
The functional currency of the Company is the Indian rupee. 
These financial statements are presented in Indian rupees 
(rounded off to crore; one crore equals ten million).
Transactions and translations
Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
are translated into the relevant functional currency at exchange 
rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains or losses 
resulting from such translations are recognized in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss and reported within exchange gains / (losses) 
on translation of assets and liabilities, net, except when deferred 
in Other Comprehensive Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. 
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated 
in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at 
the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was 
determined. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical 
cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of 
the transaction. The related revenue and expense are recognized 
using the same exchange rate.
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign 
currency transactions are included in determining net profit 
for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, 
expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the 
exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction.
Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation 
differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at 
fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as 
financial instruments and measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI).
Government grant
The Company recognizes government grants only when there is 
reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them shall 
be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government 
grants related to assets are treated as deferred income and are 
recognized in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the 
asset. Government grants related to revenue are recognized on 
a systematic basis in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss over the periods necessary to match them with the related 
costs which they are intended to compensate.

of Infosys. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment 
to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation 
or termination of employment, of an amount based on the 
respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment 
with the Company. The Company contributes Gratuity liabilities 
to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust ("the 
Trust"). Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and 
contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance 
Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.
The Company operates defined benefit pension plan in certain 
overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. 
These plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The 
plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and / or a 
lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes 
death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require 
contributions which are based on a percentage of salary that 
varies depending on the age of the respective employees.
Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are 
determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external 
actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected 
unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the 
Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate 
risk and market risk.
The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit 
plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses 
through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability 
/ (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and 
are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The 
actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields 
computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the 
defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive 
income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net 
profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.21.2 Provident fund
Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident 
fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee 
and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident 
fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered 
employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the 
Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust 
invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian 
law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government 
administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest 
is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered 
by the Government of India. The Company has an obligation 
to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the 
investments of the Trust and the notified interest rate.
2.21.3 Superannuation
Certain employees of Infosys are participants in a defined 
contribution plan. The Company has no further obligations to 
the Plan beyond its monthly contributions which are periodically 
contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is invested with 
the Life Insurance Corporation of India.
2.21.4 Compensated absences
The Company has a policy on compensated absences which 
are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The 
expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is 
determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external 
actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit 
method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed 
as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the 
Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated 
absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.

(1)	 For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered 
as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government 
bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.
(2)	 The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision 
trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.
(3)	 Attrition rate considered is the Management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been 
considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-
employment benefit obligation.

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions 
regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance 
with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions 
regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to 
the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and 
other relevant data.
The Company assesses all the above assumptions 
with its projected long-term plans of growth and 
prevalent industry standards.
The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards 
gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund 
Trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. 
The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have 
been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the 
asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the 
investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations 
applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The 
insurers' investment are diversified and provide for guaranteed 
interest rates arrangements.
Actual return on assets (including remeasurement) of the gratuity 
plan for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 were 
₹152 crore and ₹125 crore, respectively and for the pension plan 
were ₹59 crore and ₹21 crore, respectively.
The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the 
Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risk 
which are set out below:
•	
Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit 
plan liability is generally calculated using a discount rate 
determined by reference to government bond yields and in 
certain overseas jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to 
government bond yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If 
bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to 
increase.
•	
Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund 
offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash 
lump sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined 
rates for converting the lump sum to a pension and there is 
the risk that the members live longer than implied by these 
conversion rates and that the pension assets don’t achieve 
the investment return implied by these conversion rates.
•	
Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in 
equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds 
in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the 
short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible 
for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified 
given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund 
and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on 
members’ account balances.
The sensitivity of significant assumptions used for valuation of 
defined benefit obligation is as follows :

Sensitivity for significant actuarial assumptions is computed 
by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation 
of defined benefit obligation, keeping all other actuarial 
assumptions constant. In practice, this is not probable, and 
changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The Company expects to contribute ₹350 crore to gratuity and 
₹27 crore to pension during the fiscal 2026.

The actuarial valuation of PF liability exposes the Company to 
interest rate risk. The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a 
discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the 
defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
As at March 31, 2025 the defined benefit obligation would 
be affected by approximately ₹129 crore and ₹129 crore on 
account of a 0.25% increase / decrease in the expected rate of 
return on plan assets.
The Company contributed ₹1158 crore and ₹1,100 crore to the 
provident fund during the year ended March 31, 2025 and March

2.22 Earnings per equity share
Accounting Policy
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net 
profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by 
dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of equity shares 
considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also 
the weighted average number of equity shares that could have 
been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the 
proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at 
fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity 
shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted 
as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. 
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently 
for each period presented.
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity 
shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for 
any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes 
effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by 
the Board of Directors.

2.23 Contingent liabilities and commitments
Accounting policy
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present obligation that arises from 
past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
To The Members of Infosys Limited
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 
31, 2025, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Consolidated 
Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial 
Statements, give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair 
view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2025 and their consolidated 
profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated changes in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the 
year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under 
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained 
by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Key Audit Matter
1
Revenue recognition
The Group’s contracts with customers include contracts with products and services. The group derives revenues from IT 
services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, 
licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings and business process management 
services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the 
contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to 
benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.
In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor 
equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is 
recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group 
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods 
or services before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the 
promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether 
it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through 
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through 
the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize 
the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.
As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, 
(2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue 
is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these 
judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.
Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following: 
Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the 
Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis 
or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:
•	
We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) 
determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price 
maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion 
method.
•	
We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures: obligations, (2) 
determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is 
recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:
	– Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents 
that were part of the agreement.
	– Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) 
identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) 
whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion 
method

Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through 
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the 
period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, 
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method.
Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date 
as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure 
progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts 
or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on 
the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in 
which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of 
completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and 
is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This 
estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred 
to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the 
term of the contracts.
This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to 
evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.
Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Auditor’s Response
Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following: 
Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the 
following, among others:
•	
We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts 
or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls 
pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of 
efforts incurred.
•	
We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured the using percentage-of-completion method and 
performed the following:
	– Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation 
by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance 
obligations that have been fulfilled.
	– Compared efforts or costs incurred with Group’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant 
variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs 
or efforts to complete the contract.
	– Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off 
from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts 
to complete the remaining performance obligations.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during 
the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and 
presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. The 
respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have 
been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are 
responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of Directors either intends to liquidate their 
respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company 
and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the management.
•	
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
297
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
•	
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.
•	
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an 
opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial Statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters 
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably 
be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

 Annexure “A” To The Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to the Members of 
Infosys Limited of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements under Clause (i) of 
sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025, 
we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Company”) and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Control
The respective Company’s management and Boards of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies 
incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over 
financial reporting criteria established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in 
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls 
that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective 
company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the 
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference 
to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are 
companies incorporated in India.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial 
Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and 
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors 
of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to Consolidated 
Financial Statements established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Accounting policy
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash 
nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with 
investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The 
Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (contd.)
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
313
1. Overview
1.1 Company overview
Infosys Limited ("the Company" or Infosys) provides 
consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation 
digital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their 
digital transformation. Infosys' strategic objective is to build a 
sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of 
clients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and 
generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys' strategy is to 
be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on 
their journey to a digital future.
Infosys together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts is 
hereinafter referred to as "the Group".
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and 
domiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics city, 
Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company 
has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock 
Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American Depositary 
Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New 
York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
The Group's Consolidated financial statements are approved for 
issue by the Company's Board of Directors on April 17, 2025.
1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements
These Consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 
(''the Act''), guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (SEBI) and Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 
under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for 
certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values 
and defined benefit liability/(asset) which is recognized at the 
present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan 
assets. The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act 
read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except 
where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted 
or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a 
change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material 
accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited 
consolidated financial statements have been discussed in 
the respective notes.
As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded 
to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous 
quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures 
reported in this statement.
1.3 Basis of consolidation
Infosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The 
Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its 
subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over 
Overview and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
the entity, is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated 
through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant 
activities, those which significantly affect the entity's returns. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences 
until the date control ceases.
The financial statements of the Group companies are 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances 
and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such 
transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial 
statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies 
in use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent 
part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries 
that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the 
Company, are excluded.
Refer to Note 2.25 for the list of subsidiaries and controlled 
trusts of the Company
1.4 Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in 
conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make 
estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, 
judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the 
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the period. The application of 
accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates 
involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of 
assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed 
in Note 1.5. Accounting estimates could change from period 
to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Appropriate changes in estimates are made as the Management 
becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the 
estimates. Changes in estimates and judgements are reflected 
in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which 
changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
a. Revenue recognition
The Group’s contracts with customers include promises to 
transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues 
from customer contracts are considered for recognition and 
measurement when the contract has been approved, in 
writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract 
are committed to perform their respective obligations under 
the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group 
assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies 
distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of 
distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables 
and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from 
such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these 
distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
314
Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a 
straight-line basis when services are performed through an 
indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. 
Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized 
ratably using a percentage of completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer 
and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the 
period of the contract because the services are generally discrete 
in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the 
maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the 
promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in 
accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-
of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual 
efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated 
total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended 
have been used to measure progress towards completion as 
there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The 
estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment 
and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect 
any changes based on the latest available information.
Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-
party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services 
arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from 
sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of 
costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer 
and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for 
the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether 
it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they 
are transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it 
is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the 
specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and 
other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods 
or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.
Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts 
are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable 
based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
b. Income taxes
The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United 
States, though the Company also files tax returns in other 
overseas jurisdictions.
Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision 
for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / 
recovered for uncertain tax positions.
In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the 
Management considers whether some portion or all of the 
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the 
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which 
the temporary differences become deductible. Management 
considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax 
liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning 
strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of 
historical taxable income and projections for future taxable 
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets 
are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will 
realize the benefits of those deductible differences.
The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered 
realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if 
estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward 
period are reduced (Refer to Note 2.17).
c. Business combinations and intangible assets
Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, 
Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires us to fair value 
identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration 
to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations are 
conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required 
to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, 
value of option arrangements and intangible assets. These 
measurements are based on information available at the 
acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions 
that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to 
Notes 2.1 and 2.4.2).
d. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion 
of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic 
depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an 
asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at 
the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's 
assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset 
is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial 
year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar 
assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact 
their life, such as changes in technology (Refer to Note 2.2).
e. Impairment of Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and 
whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a 
Cash Generating Unit (CGUs) is less than its carrying amount. For 
the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups 
of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and 
which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on higher 
of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell. Key assumptions 
in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current 
economic conditions and comprises estimated long term growth 
rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating 
margins (Refer to Note 2.4.1).
2. Notes to the Consolidated financial statements
2.1 Business combinations
Accounting policy
Business combinations have been accounted for using the 
acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, 
Business Combinations.
The purchase price in an acquisition is measured at the fair value 
of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group. The purchase price 
also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
315
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent 
consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date 
and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially 
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at 
initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of 
subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
Business combinations between entities under common 
control is accounted for at carrying value of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's consolidated 
financial statements.
The payments related to options issued by the Group over the 
non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as 
financial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated 
present value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently 
measured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable 
under the option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. 
In the event that the option expires unexercised, the 
liability is derecognized.
Acquisition
InSemi
On May 10, 2024, Infosys Limited acquired 100% voting interests 
in InSemi Technology Services Private Limited, a semiconductor 
design services company headquartered in India. This acquisition 
is expected to strengthen our expertise in semiconductor 
ecosystem and Engineering R&D services.
The purchase price is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed based upon determination of fair values at the date of 
acquisition as follows:

The excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value 
of assets acquired has been attributed to goodwill. The primary 
items that generated this goodwill are the value of the acquired 
assembled workforce and estimated synergies, neither of which 
qualify as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is not tax-deductible.
The purchase consideration of ₹198 crore includes cash of ₹168 
crore and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value 
of ₹30 crore as on the date of acquisition.
At the acquisition date, the key inputs used in determination of 
the fair value of contingent consideration are the probabilities 
assigned towards achievement of financial targets and discount 
rate of 5.9%. The undiscounted value of contingent consideration 
as of March 31, 2025 was ₹33 crore.
Additionally, this acquisition has retention bonus and 
management incentive payable to the employees of the acquiree 
over three years, subject to their continuous employment with 
the Group and achievement of financial targets for the respective 
years. Bonus and incentives are recognized in employee 
benefit expenses in the Statement of Profit and loss over 
the period of service.
Fair value of trade receivables acquired is ₹32 crore as of 
acquisition date and as of March 31, 2025 the amounts are 
substantially collected.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with 
a business combination such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due 
diligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees are 
expensed as incurred. The transaction costs of ₹2 crore related 
to the acquisition have been included under administrative 
expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and loss for the 
three months ended June 30, 2024.
In-tech Holding GmbH
On July 17, 2024, Infosys Germany GmbH a wholly-owned 
step down subsidiary of Infosys Limited acquired 100% voting 
interests in in-tech Holding GmbH, a leading provider of 
engineering R&D services headquartered in Germany. This 
acquisition is expected to strengthen Infosys’ engineering R&D 
capabilities and reaffirms its continued commitment to global 
clients to navigate their digital engineering journey.

items that generated this goodwill are the value of the acquired 
assembled workforce and estimated synergies, neither of which 
qualify as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is not tax-deductible.
The total purchase consideration of EUR 356 million (₹3,228 crore) 
comprises the cash consideration paid to selling shareholders at 
the acquisition date.
Additionally, this acquisition has retention bonus and 
management incentive payable to the employees of the acquiree 
over two to five years, subject to their continuous employment 
with the Group and achievement of financial targets for the 
respective years. Bonus and incentives are recognized in 
employee benefit expenses in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
over the period of service.
Fair value of trade receivables acquired is ₹139 crore as of 
acquisition date and as of March 31, 2025 the amounts are 
substantially collected.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with 
a business combination such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due 
diligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees are 
expensed as incurred. The transaction costs of ₹4 crore related 
to the acquisition have been included under administrative 
expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the 
quarter ended September 30, 2024.
Proposed acquisitions
On April 17, 2025, Infosys Singapore Pte Ltd., a wholly-owned 
step down subsidiary of Infosys Limited, entered into a definitive 
agreement to acquire 100% of the equity share capital of 
The Missing Link, a leading Cybersecurity service provider 
headquartered in Australia, for a consideration including earn-
outs amounting up to AUD 98 million (approximately ₹527 crore), 
excluding management incentives, and retention bonus, subject 
to customary closing adjustments.
On April 17, 2025, Infosys Nova Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned 
step down subsidiary of Infosys Limited, entered into a definitive 
agreement to acquire 100% of the partnership interests of 
MRE Consulting Ltd, a leading Energy Consulting company, 
headquartered in USA, for a consideration including earn-
outs amounting up to $36 million (approximately ₹308 crore), 
excluding management incentives, and retention bonus , 
subject to customary closing adjustments. To consummate 
this transaction, Infosys Nova Holdings LLC has simultaneously 
incorporated an entity Infosys Energy Consulting Services LLC.
2.2 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly 
attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, 
plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the 
Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is 
derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected 
useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. 
The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over 
their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The 
estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
Buildings(1)
22-25 years
Plant and machinery(1)(2)
5 years
Office equipment
5 years
Computer equipment(1)
3-5 years
Furniture and fixtures(1)
5 years
Vehicles(1)
5 years
Leasehold improvements
Lower of useful life of the asset 
or lease term
(1)	 Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the 
useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the 
Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for 
these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of 
Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013
(2)	 Includes solar plant with a useful life of 25 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The 
useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets 
as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their 
life, such as changes in technology.
Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified 
as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost 
of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under 
‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating 
to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with these 
will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation 
are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or 
retirement of the asset.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined 
on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are largely independent of those from other 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
317
assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for 
the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to 
be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the 
assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. 
An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount 
of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, 
provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined (net of any accumulated 
depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the 
asset in prior years.

2.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets
2.4.1 Goodwill
Accounting policy
Goodwill represents the purchase consideration in excess of 
the Group's interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity. 
When the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, 
the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain 
purchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is 
measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and 
whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a 
Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For 
the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups 
of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and 
which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of 
a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable 
amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the 
higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. 
Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected 
to be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow 
projections are prepared based on current economic conditions 
and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted 
average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in 
a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of 
CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. The 
Group internally reviews the goodwill for impairment at the 
operating segment level, after allocation of the goodwill to 
CGUs or groups of CGUs.
The allocation of goodwill to operating segments as at 
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is as follows:

The goodwill pertaining to Panaya amounting to ₹996 crore and 
₹972 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively 
is tested for impairment at the entity level.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value 
less cost to sell and its value-in-use. The fair value of a CGU is 
determined based on the market capitalization. Value-in-use 
is determined based on discounted future cash flows. The key 
assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:
(In %)
Particulars
As at March 31,
2025

Long term growth rate
7-10
7-10
Operating margins
19-21
19-21
Discount rate
13
13
The above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost 
of Capital (WACC) of the Company. As at March 31, 2025, the 
estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying 
amount. Reasonable sensitivities in key assumptions is unlikely to 
cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating units.
2.4.2 Intangible Assets
Accounting policy
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their 
respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-
line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The 
estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based 
on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, 
demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the 
stability of the industry, and known technological advances) 
and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain 
the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization 
methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at 
each financial year end.
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product 
development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical 
and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future 
economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and 
ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can 
be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include 
the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly 
attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.
Impairment
Intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair 
value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an 
individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In 
such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to 
which the asset belongs.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to 
be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the 
assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. 
An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount 
of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, 
provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined (net of any accumulated 
amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the 
asset in prior years.

2.11 Financial instruments
Accounting policy
2.11.1 Initial recognition
The Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities 
when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized 
at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables 
which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair 
value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial 
recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are 
accounted for at trade date.
2.11.2 Subsequent measurement
a. Non-derivative financial instruments
(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost
A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost 
if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold 
the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI)
A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash 
flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding. The Group has made an irrevocable election for 
certain investments which are classified as equity instruments 
to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other 
comprehensive income based on its business model.
(iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL)
A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above 
categories is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.
(iv) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method, except for contingent 
consideration and financial liability under option arrangements 
recognized in a business combination which is subsequently 
measured at fair value through profit or loss.
b. Derivative financial instruments
The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign 
exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of 
changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The 
counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.
(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value 
through profit or loss.
This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities 
which are not designated as hedges.
Although the Group believes that these derivatives constitute 
hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify 
for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. 
Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or 
is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is 
categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value 
through profit or loss.
Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at 
fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in 
net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when 
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are 
measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting 
exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets/ 
liabilities in this category are presented as current assets/current 
liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be 
realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.
(ii) Cash flow hedge
Primarily, the Group designates certain foreign exchange 
forward and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate 
the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable 
forecast cash transactions.
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging 
instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value 
of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any 
ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative 
is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting 
is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging 
reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash 
flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
328
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash 
flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence 
of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount 
accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net 
profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments
The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or 
it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for 
derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a 
part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Group's 
Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.
2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments
In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, 
the Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions 
that are based on market conditions and risks existing at 
each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair 
value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing 
model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and 
dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in 
general approximation of value, and such value may never 
actually be realized.
Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the 
disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and 
liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one 
year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair 
value, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the 
short maturity of these instruments.
2.11.5 Impairment 
The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit 
loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue 
which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance 
for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant 
financing component is measured at an amount equal to 
lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are measured at 
an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which 
case those are measured at lifetime ECL. 
The Group determines the allowance for credit losses 
based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect 
current and estimated future economic conditions. The 
Group considers current and anticipated future economic 
conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the 
countries where it operates.
The amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss 
allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required 
to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, government securities, 
non convertible debentures and tax-free bonds of  
₹2,143 crore was transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 of fair 
value hierarchy, since these were valued based on quoted 
price. Further, government securities of ₹73 crore were 
transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since 
these were valued based on market observable inputs.
A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs 
used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not 
have a significant impact in its value.
Majority of investments of the Group are fair valued based on 
Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily include 
investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund 
units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial 
papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible 
debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and 
quasi-government organizations. The Group invests after 
considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria 
including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, 
Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial 
institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per the 
Group's risk management program.
Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: 
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's primary 
focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets 
and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial 
performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign 
exchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. The Group's 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual 
characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk 
from the top few customers.
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
332
Market risk
The Group operates internationally and a major portion of the 
business is transacted in several currencies and consequently 
the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales 
and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases 
from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The Group 
holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange 
forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes 
in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group is 
also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising on intercompany 
transaction in foreign currencies. The exchange rate between 
the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed 
substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in 
the future. Consequently, the results of the Group’s operations 
are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates/ depreciates 
against these currencies.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group primarily holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk 
of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank. These derivative 
financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or 
indirectly observable in the marketplace.

During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the 
Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward and 
option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of 
foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash 
transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance in 
cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2025 are expected to occur 
and will be reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss within three months.
The Group determines the existence of an economic 
relationship between the hedging instrument and the 
hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of 
its forecasted cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined 
at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through 
periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure 
that an economic relationship exists between the hedged 
item and hedging instrument, including whether the 
hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash 
flows of hedged items.
If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no 
longer optimal but the risk management objective remains 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
334
unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge 
accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by 
adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or 
the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns 
with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any 
hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss at the time of the 
hedge relationship rebalancing.

reserve for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024:

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by 
the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily 
from trade receivables amounting to ₹31,158 crore and ₹30,193 
crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively and 
unbilled revenues amounting to ₹15,083 crore and ₹14,548 crore 
as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Trade 
receivables and unbilled revenues are typically unsecured and 
are derived from revenues from customers primarily located 
in the United States of America and Europe. Credit risk has 
always been managed by the Group through credit approvals, 
establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the 
creditworthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit 
terms in the normal course of business. The Group uses the 
expected credit loss model to assess any required allowances; 
and uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit 
loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This

by the individual characteristic of each customer and the 
concentration of risk from the top few customers. Exposure 
to customers is diversified and there is no single customer 
contributing more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables 
and unbilled revenues.

As at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 2,88,384 and 2,91,795 
cash settled options were outstanding respectively. The carrying 
value of liability towards cash settled share based payments 
was ₹18 crore and ₹13 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 
31, 2024 respectively.
The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes 
Model for time and non-market performance-based options and 
Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options.
The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, 
exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected 
term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility 
during the expected term of the options is based on historical 
volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's 
publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to 
the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the 
comparative company have been modelled based on historical 
movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity 
shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of 
the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between 
each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each 
entity in the peer group.

2.16 Provisions
Accounting policy
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably 
estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The Group 
recognizes a reimbursement asset when, and only when, it is 
virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received if the 
Group settles the obligation.
a. Post-sales client support
The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period post sales 
support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs 
associated with such support services are accrued at the time 
related revenues are recorded and included in Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss. The Group estimates such costs 
based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on 
a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and 
likelihood of occurrence.
b. Onerous contracts
Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future 
obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, if 
any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which 
such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or 
costs to complete the contract. The provision is measured at the 
present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating 
the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the 
contract. Before a provision is established the Group recognizes 
any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

Provision for post sales client support and other 
provisions is included in cost of sales in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.
2.17 Income taxes
Accounting policy
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income 
tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. 
Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized 
at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the 
tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for 
all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial 
statements except when the deferred income tax arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the 
transaction. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting 
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that the related tax benefit will be realized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to 
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences 
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes 
in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
345
recognized as income or expense in the period that includes 
the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred 
income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. 
Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed 
earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that 
the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in 
the foreseeable future.
The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a 
legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts 
and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize 
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The income 
tax provision for the interim period is made based on the best 
estimate of the annual average tax rate expected to be applicable 
for the full financial year. Tax benefits of deductions earned on 
exercise of employee share options in excess of compensation 
charged to income are credited to equity.

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the year 
ended March 31, 2025 is 25.17% and for the year ended March 
31, 2024 was 34.94%.
Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 
31, 2024 includes provisions (net of reversals) of  
₹132 crore and reversals (net of provisions) of ₹937 crore, 
respectively. These provisions and reversals pertaining to prior 
periods are primarily on account of adjudication of certain 
disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of 
assessments, across various jurisdictions.
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company received 
orders under section 250 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, from the 
Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2016-17 
and 2019-20. These orders confirmed the Company's position 
with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a 
result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹327 crore was recognised and 
provision for income tax aggregating ₹183 crore was reversed 
with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. 
Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to 
1,068 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.
During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received 
orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, 
from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment 
years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders 
confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment 
of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pre-
tax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognized and provision for income 
tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding 
credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution 
of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been 
reduced from contingent liabilities.
The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable 
overseas principally in the United States. In India, the Group has 
benefited from certain tax incentives that the Government of 
India had provided for export of software and services from the 
units registered under the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Act, 
2005 in the prior years. SEZ units which began the provision 
of services on or after April 1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction 
of 100% of profits or gains derived from the export of services 
for the first five years from the financial year in which the unit 
commenced the provision of services and 50% of such profits 
or gains for further five years. Up to 50% of such profits or gains 
is also available for a further five years subject to creation of a 
Special Economic Zone re-Investment Reserve out of the profit 
of the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the 
Group for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose 
of its business as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 
1961. (Refer to Special Economic Zone Re-investment reserve 
under Note 2.12 Equity)
Deferred income tax for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 
March 31, 2024 substantially relates to origination and reversal of 
temporary differences.
Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to 
the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
346
than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the 
year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. 
As at March 31, 2025, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to 
approximately ₹7,755 crore. As at March 31, 2025, the Company 
has a deferred tax liability for Branch Profit Tax of ₹271 crore (net 
of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits 
are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future
Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on 
temporary differences amounting to ₹16,593 crore and ₹10,776 
crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively, 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches as 
the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The 
Group majorly intends to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries 
and branches only to the extent these can be distributed 
in a tax-free manner.
Deferred income tax assets have not been recognized on 
accumulated losses of ₹4,597 crore and ₹4,668 crore as at 
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively, as it is probable 
that future taxable profit will not be available against which the 
unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future.

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the 
management considers whether some portion or all of the 
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon 
the generation of future taxable income during the periods 
in which the temporary differences become deductible. The 
management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred 
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax 
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level 
of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable 
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets 
are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will 
realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount 
of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, 
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable 
income during the carry forward period are reduced.
The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired 
in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and 
currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best 
estimate determined based on the expected value method.
2.18 Revenue from operations
Accounting policy
The Group derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising 
software development and related services, cloud and 
infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package 
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms 
across the Group’s core and digital offerings (together called as 
“software-related services”) and business process management 
services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-
material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.
Revenues from customer contracts are considered for 
recognition and measurement when the contract has been 
approved in writing by the parties, to the contract, the parties to 
contract are committed to perform their respective obligations 
under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. 
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised 
products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group has 
received or expects to receive in exchange for these products 
or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as 
to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such 
uncertainty is resolved.
The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and 
identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. 
The Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling 
price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold 
separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. 
In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to 
estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a 
margin, under which the Group estimates the cost of satisfying 
the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate 
margin based on similar services.
The Group’s contracts may include variable consideration 
including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Group 
includes variable consideration as part of transaction price 
when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of 
the variable consideration and when it is probable that a 
significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will 
not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable 
consideration is resolved.
Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts, 
are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-
line basis when services are performed through an indefinite 
number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably 
using a percentage of completion method when the pattern 
of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and 
the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the 
period of contract because the services are generally discrete 
in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, 
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations 
are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to 
determine progress towards completion as there is a direct 
relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards 
completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to 
date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs 
or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts 
are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and 
are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates 
change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the 
estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the 
contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on 
incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such 
losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs 
to complete the contract.
The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic 
performance based billing and / or milestone based progress 
billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled 
revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as 
contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).
In arrangements for software development and related 
services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue 
recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, 
the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria 
for considering software development and related services as 
distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction 
price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each 
performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone 
selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item 
when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone 
selling price. In cases where the Group is unable to determine 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
349
the standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost 
plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling 
price. For software development and related services, the 
performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services 
are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the 
work as it progresses.
Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include 
multiple elements which may be subject to other specific 
accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts 
are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting 
guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to 
determine that hardware and services are distinct performance 
obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance 
obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the 
absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected 
cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone 
selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a 
single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over 
the period and measure of progress is determined based on 
promise in the contract.
Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right 
to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license 
are made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses 
where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized 
over the access period.
Arrangements to deliver software products generally have 
three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical 
Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in 
conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license 
and implementation have been identified as two distinct 
separate performance obligations, the transaction price for 
such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of 
the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. 
In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, 
the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in 
estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license 
is required to be substantially customized as part of the 
implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license 
and implementation is considered to be a single performance 
obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method as the implementation is performed. 
Revenue from client training, support and other services arising 
due to the sale of software products is recognized as the 
performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized 
ratably on a straight line basis over the period in which the 
services are rendered.
Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or 
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated 
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue 
from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded 
net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between 
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is 
the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first 
evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or 
services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group 
considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the 
promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory 
risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it 
controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting 
as a principal or an agent.
A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both 
of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. 
A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct 
performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate 
contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone 
selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and 
creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone 
selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct 
performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing 
contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs 
that would not have been incurred if the contract had not 
been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Group 
expects to recover them.
Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition 
or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate 
performance obligation are recognized as an asset when 
such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate 
or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in 
satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are 
expected to be recovered.
Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to 
customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs 
are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life 
on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or 
services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs 
are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are 
recorded when present value of projected remaining operating 
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of 
the capitalized costs.
The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

included in segment information (Refer to Note 2.26). The table

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for 
the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is 54% 
and 53%, respectively.
Trade receivables and contract balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections 
results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue 
on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed 
as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual 
terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or 
upon achievement of contractual milestones.
The Group’s receivables are rights to consideration that are 
unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess 
of billings from time and material contracts and fixed price 
maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when 
the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only 
after a passage of time.
Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on 
milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of 
revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to 
the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed-price 
contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset 
because the right to consideration is dependent on completion 
of contractual milestones.
Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of 
impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.
During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the 
Company recognized revenue of ₹5,669 crore and ₹5,432 crore 
arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2024 and 
April 1, 2023 respectively.
During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 
₹4,896 crore and ₹7,023 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining 
to other fixed-price and fixed time-frame contracts as 
of April 1, 2024 and April 1, 2023, respectively has been 
reclassified to Trade receivables upon billing to customers on 
completion of milestones.
Remaining performance obligation disclosure
The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the 
aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized 
as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to 
when the Group expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. 
Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the 
Group has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation 
related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized 
corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the 
entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts 
where invoicing is on time and material and unit of work based 
contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are 
subject to change and are affected by several factors, including 
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic 
revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized 
and adjustments for currency fluctuations.
The aggregate value of performance obligations that are 
completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2025, other 
than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, 
is ₹1,04,785 crore. Out of this, the Group expects to recognize 
revenue of around 50.3% within the next one year and the 
remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance 
obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at 
March 31, 2024 is ₹90,658 crore. The contracts can generally 
be terminated by the customers and typically includes an 
enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally, 
customers have not terminated contracts without cause.
2.19 Other income, net
Accounting policy
Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend 
income, gain/loss on investment and exchange gain/loss on 
forward and options contracts and on translation of foreign 
currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using 
the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized 
when the right to receive payment is established.
Foreign currency
Accounting policy
Functional currency
The functional currency of Infosys, its Indian subsidiaries and 
controlled trusts is the Indian rupee. The functional currencies for 
foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. These 
financial statements are presented in Indian rupees (rounded off 
to crore; one crore equals ten million).
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
351
Transactions and translations
Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
are translated into the relevant functional currency at 
exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains 
or losses resulting from such translations are recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and reported 
within exchange gains/ (losses) on translation of assets and 
liabilities, net, except when deferred in Other Comprehensive 
Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. Non-monetary assets 
and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate 
prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-
monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a 
foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated 
at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction. 
The related revenue and expense are recognized using 
the same exchange rate.
Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign 
currency transactions are included in determining net profit 
for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, 
expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the 
exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction.
The translation of financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries 
to the presentation currency is performed for assets and 
liabilities using the exchange rate in effect at the Balance Sheet 
date and for revenue, expense and cash-flow items using the 
average exchange rate for the respective periods. The gains or 
losses resulting from such translation are included in currency 
translation reserves under other components of equity. When 
a subsidiary is disposed off, in full, the relevant amount is 
transferred to net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss. However when a change in the parent's ownership 
does not result in loss of control of a subsidiary, such changes are 
recorded through equity.
Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation 
differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at 
fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as 
financial instruments and measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI).
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate in effect at 
the Balance Sheet date.
Government grant
The Group recognizes government grants only when there is 
reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them shall 
be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government 
grants related to assets are treated as deferred income and are 
recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of 
the asset. Government grants related to revenue are recognized 
on a systematic basis in net profit in the Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to match them with 
the related costs which they are intended to compensate.

2.21 Leases 
Accounting policy
The Group as a lessee
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for 
land, buildings and computers. The Group assesses whether a 
contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset, the group assesses 
whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) 
the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use 
of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has 
the right to direct the use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes 
a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability 
for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and 
low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the 
Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
As a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the non-
cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend 
or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably 
certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease 
term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is 
reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the 
contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group 
considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements 
undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination 
of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to 
Group’s operations taking into account the location of the 
underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The 
lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease 
term reflects the current economic circumstances.
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or 
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised.
The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or prior to the commencement date of 
the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. 
They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.
The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and 
useful life of the underlying asset.
The ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost 
to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset 
basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the 
present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments 
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, 
if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing 
rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities

are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related 
ROU asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will 
exercise an extension or a termination option.

2.22 Employee benefits
Accounting policy
Gratuity and pensions
The Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement 
plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible employees majorly of 
Infosys and its Indian subsidiaries. The Gratuity Plan provides a 
lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, 
incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount 
based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of 
employment with the Group. The Company contributes Gratuity 
liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust 
("the Trust"). In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions 
are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust 
and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust, 
respectively. Trustees administer contributions made to the 
Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life 
Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.
The Group operates defined benefit pension plan in certain 
overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. These 
plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The plans 
provide for periodic payouts after retirement and/or a lumpsum 
payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death 
and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require 
contributions which are based on a percentage of salary that 
varies depending on the age of the respective employees.
Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are 
determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external 
actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected 
unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the 
Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate 
risk and market risk.
The Group recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit 
plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses 
through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability / 
(asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are 
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
355
not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed 
by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect 
of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Provident fund
Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and 
the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. 
The Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust invests in specific designated 
instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government administered pension fund. The rate at 
which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government of India. The Company has 
an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the trust and the notified interest rate.
In respect of Indian subsidiaries, eligible employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined contribution plan. Both 
the eligible employee and the respective companies make monthly contributions to this provident fund plan equal to a specified 
percentage of the covered employee's salary. Amounts collected under the provident fund plan are deposited in a government 
administered provident fund. The Companies have no further obligation to the plan beyond its monthly contributions.
Superannuation
Certain employees of Infosys, Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve are participants in a defined contribution plan. The Group has no further 
obligations to the plan beyond its monthly contributions which are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is 
invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of India.
Compensated absences
The Group has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost 
of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external actuary at each Balance Sheet 
date using projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of the unused entitlement 
that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in 
which the absences occur.

(1)	 For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered 
as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government 
bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.
(2)	 The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision 
trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.
(3)	 Attrition rate considered is the management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been 
considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-
employment benefit obligation.
For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions 
regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance 
with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions 
regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to 
the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and 
other relevant data.
The Group assesses all of the above assumptions 
with its projected long-term plans of growth and 
prevalent industry standards.
The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards 
gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. 
In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to 
the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve 
Systems Limited Employees Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively. 
Trustees administer contributions made to the trust as at 
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, and contributions for gratuity 
are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India as permitted by Indian law. The plan assets of the 
overseas defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in 
insurer managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is 
determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under 
the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the 
insurer managers. The insurers' investment are diversified and 
provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements.
Actual return on assets (including remeasurements) of the 
gratuity plan for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 
2024 were ₹173 crore and ₹145 crore, respectively and for the 
pension plan were ₹79 crore and ₹36 crore, respectively.
The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the 
Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risk 
which are set out below:
Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan 
liability is generally calculated using a discount rate determined 
by reference to government bond yields and in certain overseas 
jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to government bond 
yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If bond yields fall, the 
defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund 
offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lump 
sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for 
converting the lump sum to a pension and there is the risk that 
the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates 
and that the pension assets don’t achieve the investment return 
implied by these conversion rates.
Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in 
equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds 
in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the 
short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible 
for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified 
given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund 
and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on 
members’ account balances.

Sensitivity to significant actuarial assumptions is computed

assumptions constant. In practice, this is not probable, and 
changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
The Group expects to contribute ₹370 crore to gratuity and ₹44 
crore to pension during the fiscal 2026.

predominantly considering the social and economic factors. The 
actuary has provided a valuation for provident fund liabilities on 
the basis of guidance issued by the Actuarial Society of India.

(1) 	 In India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not 
developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount 
rate. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-
term trend of employees’ average remaining service life which reflects the 
average estimated term of the post- employment benefit obligations.
The break-up of the plan assets into various categories as at 
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 are as follows:

The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the 
investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations.
The actuarial valuation of provident fund liability exposes 
the Group to interest rate risk. The defined benefit obligation 
calculated uses a discount rate based on government 
bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation 
will tend to increase.
As at March 31, 2025, the defined benefit obligation would be 
affected by approximately ₹129 crore on account of a 0.25% 
increase / decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.
The Group contributed ₹1,323 crore and ₹1,257 crore to the 
provident fund during the year ended March 31, 2025 and 
March 31, 2024, respectively. The same has been recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss under the head 
employee benefit expense.
The provident plans are applicable only to employees drawing a 
salary in Indian rupees.
2.22.3 Superannuation
The Group contributed ₹512 crore and ₹513 crore during the

2.23 Earnings per equity share
Accounting policy
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net 
profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by 
dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of 
the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares 
considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also 
the weighted average number of equity shares that could have 
been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the 
proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at 
fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity 
shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted 
as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. 
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently 
for each period presented.
The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity 
shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for 
any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes 
effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by 
the Board of Directors.

2.24 Contingent liabilities and commitments
Accounting policy
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past 
events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present 
obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized 
because it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured 
with sufficient reliability.

acknowledged as debts in respect of income tax matters amounted to 
₹1,933 crore and ₹2,794 crore, respectively.
The claims against the Group primarily represent demands 
arising on completion of assessment proceedings under the 
Income Tax Act, 1961. These claims are on account of issues of 
disallowance of expenditure towards software being held as 
capital in nature, payments made to Associated Enterprises held 
as liable for withholding of taxes, among others. These matters 
are pending before various Income Tax Authorities and the 
Management including its tax advisors expect that its position 
will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a 
material adverse effect on the Group's financial position and 
results of operations.
Amount paid to statutory authorities against the tax claims 
amounted to ₹4,199 crore and ₹8,743 crore as at March 31, 2025 
and March 31, 2024, respectively.
2.24.2 Legal proceedings
McCamish Cybersecurity incident 
In November 2023, certain systems of Infosys McCamish 
Systems LLC (“McCamish”), a subsidiary of Infosys BPM Limited 
(a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infosys Limited), were encrypted 
by ransomware, resulting in the non-availability of certain 
applications and systems. McCamish initiated its incident 
response and engaged cybersecurity and other specialists 
to assist in its investigation of and response to the incident 
and remediation and restoration of impacted applications 
and systems. By December 31, 2023, McCamish, with external 
specialists’ assistance, substantially remediated and restored the 
affected applications and systems. Actions taken by McCamish 
included investigative analysis conducted by a third-party 
cybersecurity firm to determine, among other things, whether 
and the extent to which the Company or customer data was 
subject to unauthorized access or exfiltration. McCamish also 
engaged a third-party eDiscovery vendor in assessing the extent 
and nature of such data. McCamish in coordination with its third-
party eDiscovery vendor has identified corporate customers 
and individuals whose information was subject to unauthorized 
access and exfiltration. McCamish processes personal data on 
behalf of its corporate customers.
Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25
361
From March 6, 2024 through July 25, 2024, six actions were filed 
in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia 
against McCamish. The actions arise out of the cybersecurity 
incident at McCamish initially disclosed on November 3, 2023.  
All six actions have since been consolidated, and the 
consolidated class action complaint was filed on November 
7, 2024, purportedly on behalf of all persons residing in the 
United States whose personally identifiable information was 
compromised in the incident, including all who were sent 
a notice of the incident. On December 20, 2024, the Court 
granted the parties’ joint motion to stay proceedings pending 
the parties’ efforts to resolve the lawsuit through mediation. 
On March 13, 2025, McCamish and the plaintiffs engaged in 
mediation, resulting in an in-principle agreement that sets forth 
the terms of a proposed settlement of the class action lawsuits 
against McCamish, as well as seven class action lawsuits arising 
out of the incident that have been filed against McCamish’s 
customers. Under the settlement terms, McCamish has agreed 
to pay $17.5 million (approximately ₹150 crore) into a fund to 
settle these matters. The agreed terms are subject to finalization 
of the terms of the settlement agreement, and preliminary 
and final court approval. If approved, the settlement will 
resolve all allegations made in the class action lawsuits without 
admission of any liability. 
McCamish has recorded an accrual of $17.5 million 
(approximately ₹150 crore) related to the settlement. McCamish 
has recognized an insurance reimbursement receivable of $17 
million (approximately ₹145 crore) which has been offset against 
the settlement expense of $17.5 million (approximately ₹150 
crore) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. McCamish may incur 
additional costs including from indemnities or damages/claims, 
which are indeterminable at this time.
Others
Apart from legal proceedings and claims arising from the 
McCamish cybersecurity incident, the Group is subject to legal 
proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course 
of business. The Group’s management reasonably expects that 
such ordinary course legal actions, when ultimately concluded 
and determined, will not have a material and adverse effect on 
the Group’s results of operations or financial condition.

2.26 Segment reporting
Ind AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the 
way that public business enterprises report information about 
operating segments and related disclosures about products 
and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The 
Group's operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-
end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business 
performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) 
evaluates the Group's performance and allocates resources based 
on an analysis of various performance indicators by business 
segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along 
business segments. The accounting principles used in the 
preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied 
to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and 
are as set out in the accounting policies.
Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in 
Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, 
enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, 
enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, 
enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, 
enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare 
and all other segments. The Financial services reportable 
segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services 
operating segment and Finacle operating segment because 
of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other 
segments represent the operating segments of businesses 
in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services and other 
enterprises in Public Services.
Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to 
segments are categorized based on items that are individually 
identifiable to that segment. Revenue for 'all other segments' 
represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and 
revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan 
and China and other enterprises in Public services. Allocated 
expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering 
services from the Group's offshore software development 
centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in 
relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain 
expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form 
a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically 
allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are 
used interchangeably. 
The Management believes that it is not practical to provide 
segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, 
and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as 
"unallocated" and adjusted against the total income of the Group.
Assets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not 
identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used 
interchangeably between segments. The Management believes 
that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures 
relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful 
segregation of the available data is onerous.
Business segment revenue information is collated based on 
individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue 
is otherwise recognized.
Disclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in Note 
2.18, Revenue from operations.

distributed by a company on or after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members. The Company shall therefore be required 
to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of final dividend. To enable us to determine the appropriate TDS 
rate as applicable, members are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the below paragraphs, in accordance with 
the provisions of the IT Act.

Aadhaar. In case of failure to comply with this, the PAN allotted shall be deemed to be invalid / inoperative and he shall be liable to all consequences under 
the IT Act and tax shall be deducted at the higher rates as provided in section 206AA of the IT Act, 1961 i.e., 20% of tax deduction at source.
However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend payable to resident individual shareholders if the total dividend to be received by 
them during financial year 2025-2026 does not exceed ₹10,000 and also in cases where members provide Form 15G / Form 15H (Form 
15H is applicable to resident individual shareholders aged 60 years or more), subject to conditions specified in the IT Act. Resident 
shareholders may also submit any other document as prescribed under the IT Act to claim a lower / nil withholding of tax. PAN is 
mandatory for members providing Form 15G / 15H or any other document as mentioned above.
For non-resident shareholders, taxes are required to be withheld in accordance with the provisions of Section 195 and other 
applicable sections of the IT Act, at the rates in force. The withholding tax shall be at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge 
and cess) or as notified by the GOI on the amount of dividend payable. However, as per Section 90 of the IT Act, non‑resident 
shareholders have the option to be governed by the provisions of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), read with

Notes
(1)	 In order to leverage efficiencies of scale and optimize the resources available in the group, resources are shared within the group. Accordingly, purchase, sale of services and shared services majorly includes transfer 
of manpower, sharing of business enabling services like Finance & Accounting, Legal Support, Purchase & Facility Management, Human Resource Management Services, Risk Management, Information Security, 
Management Support, software license and other administrative services.
(2)	 Transactions between the Stater entities in the Netherlands (HypoCasso B.V.; Stater XXL B.V.; Stater Nederland and Stater N.V.) are generally on a cost basis as all these entities are under a tax group and file a single 
tax return. The transactions between other subsidiaries are either on a cost-sharing or cost-plus-markup basis depending on the respective local regulations on transfer pricing. All transactions are at arm’s length 
basis.
(3)	 As a part of an ongoing program of entity rationalization, the Company may from time to time propose merger / demerger of entities within the Group. These mergers are generally based on the local regulatory 
requirements and are accounted for as transactions under common control under the relevant accounting standards.
(4)	 Equity infusion by Stater N.V. is to strengthen subsidiary operational capabilities.
(5)	 Key financial information of each of the subsidiaries is available in annexure 1 to the boards report forming part of this annual report
(6)	 Percentage is calculated based on the standalone turnover of Stater N.V.
