## Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.

Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.

This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Form 10-K.

## Macroeconomic and Industry Risks

## The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales. In addition, the Company's global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company's supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.
