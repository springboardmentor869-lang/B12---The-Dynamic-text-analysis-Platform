The interface supports user registration, login, data upload AI Powered Shell Using NLP and System Automation • This project is about creating a smart command-line tool that understands everyday English. • Instead of typing complex shell commands, users can simply write what they want in 'plain language', and the system will understand and do it for them. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to figure out what the user means and turn their words into proper commands. • SKILLS • Python • HTML • CSS • MySQL EXTRA CARRICULAR ACTIVITIES • Won second prize in Arts Day Mime Competition. • Took part in inter-departmental Group Dance Competition on Arts Day • Event Coordinator for Dance Competition - Arts Day • Member of IC-FOSS. • Member of Computer Society of India • Member of National Service Scheme.
