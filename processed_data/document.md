**The Dragon Who Was Bad at Being Scary**

Once upon a bedtime, in a forest that smelled like pine needles and snacks, lived a little dragon named **Puffin** .
Puffin was *supposed* to be scary. Dragons do scary. It’s literally in the job description.

Problem: Puffin sneezed when he tried to roar.

“RAAA— *achoo!* ”
Yeah. Terrifying.

Instead of fire, Puffin blew out **warm sparkles** , like a birthday candle that went to art school. The other dragons were like, “Bro… respectfully… what is that?”

So Puffin left to find his *thing* .

He met a **Cloud** who forgot how to rain.
“I just float now,” said the Cloud, insecure but chill.
Puffin warmed it with his sparkles. Boom—gentle rain. Plants said thank you. Farmers cried happy tears.

Then Puffin met the **Moon** , who couldn’t sleep.
“I’m tired of shining,” the Moon yawned.
Puffin hummed a soft song (dragons can sing, don’t question it). The Moon dozed off. Stars tucked it in. Whole sky went “aww.”

By the time Puffin returned home, the forest followed him.
“Stay,” they said. “You help.”

The big dragons finally noticed.
“You’re not scary,” they admitted.
Puffin nodded. “I know.”

“And that,” said the wisest dragon, “is actually kinda legendary.”

So Puffin became the **Dragon of Comfort** —
warming cold nights, fixing sad clouds, helping moons nap.

And every night, when kids closed their eyes, a tiny sparkle drifted past their windows, whispering:

“You’re safe. Sleep. I got this.”

The end.
