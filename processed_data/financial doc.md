The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), as developed and approved by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB).

The report of the External Auditor on the audit of the 2020 financial statements, together with his opinion on the financial statements, are also submitted to the WIPO Assemblies as prescribed under Regulation 8.11 and Annex II of the FRR.

The annual financial report, including financial statement discussion and analysis, is presented in this document alongside the financial statements and the annual statement on internal control.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The following financial statement discussion and analysis includes an overview of the Organization's operations and environment, financial objectives and strategies, risk management strategy, financial performance and financial position  during  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020.  This  year,  due  to  the unprecedented  global impact  of  the COVID-19 pandemic, a separate overview of its effects on the Organization's operations and financial results has also been included. The discussion and analysis has been prepared in accordance with IPSASB Recommended Practice Guideline 2, and is intended to provide an explanation of the significant items, transactions, and events presented in the financial statements and the factors that influenced them. This discussion and analysis is not part of WIPO's financial statements; however it should be read together with WIPO's financial statements.

## Operations and Environment

WIPO is the global forum for intellectual property services, policy, information and cooperation. It is a specialized agency of the United Nations, with 193 Member States. The Organization's mission is to lead the development of a balanced and effective global intellectual property ecosystem to promote innovation and creativity for a better and more sustainable future. The Organization's mandate, governing bodies and procedures are set out in the WIPO Convention of 1967, which established WIPO.

WIPO's Member States determine the direction, budget and activities of the Organization through the decisionmaking bodies. The main policy and decision-making bodies of WIPO are the General Assembly, the Conference and the Coordination Committee. The General Assembly consists of States party to the WIPO Convention which are members of any of the Unions administered by WIPO. The General Assembly constituted the Program and Budget  Committee  to  consider  matters  relating  to  program,  budget,  premises  and  finance.  The  Conference  is composed of the States party to the WIPO Convention whether or not they are members of any of the Unions, and is, inter alia , the competent body for adopting amendments to the Convention. The Coordination Committee consists of elected members of the Executive Committees of the Paris or the Berne Unions, or both, one-fourth of the States party to the WIPO Convention which are not members of any of the Unions, and Switzerland, as the State on whose territory the Organization has its headquarters.

The General Assembly appoints the WIPO Director General upon nomination by the Coordination Committee. The current Director General, Mr Daren Tang, was appointed on May 8, 2020, and began his six-year term on October 1, 2020. Mr Tang succeeds Mr Francis Gurry, who served as WIPO Director General from October 1, 2008.  The Director General is the chief executive of the Organization. The Director General is assisted by the Sector Leads (consisting of the Deputy Directors General and the Assistant Directors General) in providing the strategic direction of WIPO's programs and in managing their respective Sectors to ensure the delivery of results in line with the Organization's strategic goals and the Program and Budget.

WIPO generates most of its revenue from fees that are paid by users of its intellectual property services for patents, trademarks and industrial designs. These services are provided through the  Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), Madrid and Hague systems. In 2020, fees from these activities represented 94.3 per cent of the Organization's total revenue, with PCT system fees alone representing 76.6 per cent. The driver for revenue from these fee-based services is the international demand for intellectual property titles. Other external factors that may influence the Organization's  revenue  from  its  fee-based  services  include  research  and  development  investment  levels, technological confidence levels, and exchange rate fluctuations.

## ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT

## Financial Objectives and Strategies

The financial activities of WIPO are governed by its Financial Regulations, which are approved by the General Assembly. Financial Rules are established by the Director General in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulations. WIPO's Member States are informed of any modification of the Financial Rules. The Financial Rules govern  all the financial management  activities  of the  Organization. Authority and  responsibility for the implementation of the Financial Regulations and Rules is delegated by the Director General to the Controller.

Every two years, the Director General presents a Program and Budget to Member States for approval. It details expected  results,  performance  measures  and  budgetary  planning  for  all  proposed  activities.  The  Program  and Budget for the 2020/21 biennium was approved by the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO in October 2019. The Program and Budget provides the planning for the biennium within the overall strategic context of the MediumTerm Strategic Plan.

The Organization uses a Results-Based Management system to ensure that resources are budgeted and utilized in line with organizational results and priorities. Organizational performance is measured and analyzed on a regular basis through performance indicators, targets and baselines. Under this system, both the Program and Budget and the  Medium-Term  Strategic  Plan  form  part  of  WIPO's  planning  framework,  along  with  annual  work  plans  and individual staff objectives.

The Organization manages the levels of its reserves in accordance with its Policy on Reserves. WIPO's reserves are accounted for as the net assets of the Organization, and serve to minimize the impact of income shortfalls and maximize the probability that the Organization can meet its obligations in the short term and maintain financial stability.  One  core  element  of  the  policy  is  the  mechanism  for  establishing  the  required  level  of  reserves  as a percentage of the estimated biennial expenditure of the Unions administered by the Organization. The policy also establishes  the  principles  and  approval  mechanism  for  the  use  of  reserves  for  one-time  projects  for  capital improvements and exceptional circumstances.

The Organization manages its investments in accordance with its Policy on Investments. The policy states that the primary objectives of the Organization's investment management, in order of importance, shall be: (i) preservation of capital; (ii) liquidity and (iii) within the constraints of (i) and (ii), the rate of return. The Organization aims to achieve a market rate of return whenever appropriate and possible for both operating and core cash. Strategic cash is to be invested over the long-term in order to achieve capital growth and thus an overall positive return over time.

## Risk Management

WIPO's Risk Management Policy sets out the Organization's approach to managing risks and internal controls in a consistent and business-oriented manner, in order to support the achievement of its strategic goals and expected results. It is complemented by WIPO's Risk and Internal Control Management Manual, which covers the day-to-day operational  details  of  risk  and  internal  control  management.  The  policy  and  the  manual,  together  with  the organizational  arrangements,  the  establishment  of  roles  and  responsibilities,  processes  and  activities  for  the management of risks and internal controls represent WIPO's Risk Management Framework.

Under the guiding principles of WIPO's Risk Management Policy, risk management is considered an organizationwide responsibility. Organizational level risks are identified and reviewed by WIPO's Risk Management Group, which is chaired by the Director General. Risk management is performed as an integral part of the Organization's Results-Based Management cycle. WIPO's Risk Management Framework is guided by the risk appetite noted by its Member States in WIPO's Risk Appetite Statement.

## COVID-19 Pandemic

The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020. It subsequently declared the outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The pandemic became a global challenge and impacted the global economy in an unprecedented manner. In its 2019 financial statements, WIPO disclosed the outbreak as a non-adjusting event after the reporting date, in accordance with IPSAS 14. This disclosure stated that, given the global effects of the pandemic, there would be significant impacts on the Organization's operations in 2020, the extent of which could not reliably be estimated at that time. While the eventual impact on the way WIPO conducted its business in 2020 was profound, the direct, visible and measurable impact on the financial performance for 2020 and the financial position at the end of the year was more limited. Although there can be no objective or exact method of  determining the complete impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these financial statements, certain broad trends can be identified and are reflected in the following summary of the effects of the pandemic on WIPO's operations and financial results.

On March 17, 2020, WIPO premises at its headquarters in Geneva were closed in the face of the evolving health crisis  and lockdown decisions made by the Host Government. Physical access to WIPO was limited to a small critical presence needed to perform essential services on premises; all other staff continued to work remotely. The

Organization already had in place a Business Continuity Plan that addressed the threat of significant disruption to critical functions, and was quickly able to adjust to these unprecedented circumstances. During the initial phase of the crisis, staff were provided laptops and other equipment to permit them to connect to WIPO systems safely from remote locations. WIPO services, including fee-based and support services, rapidly attained near-optimal capacity. With the gradual decline of infection rates in the Geneva region, and the scaling back of lockdown measures by the Host  Government,  WIPO  initiated  a  carefully  planned  and  phased  return-to-premises  program  in  June  2020. However, in October 2020 the epidemiological situation in Geneva rapidly deteriorated as the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic gripped most of the world. This culminated in the Host Government issuing a new series of recommendations, including for employers to implement remote working as much as possible. As of November 2, 2020, all WIPO personnel, except those required to be on-site, resumed remote working.

The Organization monitored its directly related COVID-19 expenditure during 2020, which totaled approximately 3.6 million  Swiss  francs.  This  concerned  principally  expenditure  on  IT  equipment  and  IT  services  to  meet  remote working and virtual or hybrid meeting requirements. Other expenditure considered directly related to the impacts of COVID-19 on the Organization's operations included cleaning and disinfection products, furniture and equipment for new layout requirements, purchase of medical supplies, additional medical staff, and lunch allowances. Travel bans and restrictions  during  2020  had  a  significant  impact  on WIPO's  activities  involving  traditional,  in-person implementation modalities,  especially  in  the  areas  of capacity  building  and support  services.  This  required  the Organization to adapt its delivery methods in order to respond to the constraints caused by the pandemic. In financial terms, the cost of missions for staff and consultants fell from 5.7 million Swiss francs in 2019, to 0.5 million Swiss francs  in  2020.  Official  meetings  and  conferences  moved  to  hybrid  and  virtual  modes  during  the  year.  The Organization's third party travel costs, including participants and lecturers, fell from 10.5 million Swiss francs in 2019 to 0.5 million Swiss francs in 2020.

WIPO's revenue from fees charged for applications under the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems is recognized at the date of publication of the application, in accordance with the requirements of IPSAS. As publication takes place some time after  the  filing  of  an  application,  revenue  levels  from  these  systems  do  not  necessarily  provide  an immediate indication of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the Organization. Looking more specifically at filings of applications in 2020, overall demand for WIPO's fee-based services under its intellectual property systems remained  strong  considering  the  unprecedented  circumstances.  Revenue  from  the  PCT  system,  based  on publications of PCT applications in the year, was 6.1 per cent higher than in 2019, totaling 358.6 million Swiss francs. PCT application filings also grew in 2020, reaching an estimated 275,900 applications, a record figure and a 4.0 per cent increase on the 2019 number of 265,381. Revenue from the Madrid system, again recognized at the date of publication of the application, fell by 0.8 per cent compared to 2019, totaling 76.2 million Swiss francs. Use of the Madrid system also slightly decreased in 2020. International trademark applications totaled an estimated 63,800, down by 0.6 per cent on the 2019 number of 64,168, representing the first decline since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. This was expected, given that trademarks tend to represent the introduction of new goods and services, both of which slowed as a result of the global pandemic. The economic fallout from the pandemic also hit demand for the protection of industrial designs via the Hague system. Applications fell by 1.7 per cent, and designs in those applications dropped by 15.0 per cent. Revenue from the Hague system in 2020 actually increased from 5.3 million Swiss francs in 2019 to 6.7 million Swiss francs as registration publication volumes increased over the year. The reduced demand for the Hague system seen in 2020 may be expected to impact revenue in 2021.

Concerning the Organization's assets, as at each year end and in accordance with the requirements of IPSAS, WIPO performed its annual impairment reviews to ensure that assets were recorded at an appropriate value in the financial statements. This exercise did not indicate any impairment attributable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The  review  of  financial  instruments  including  accounts  receivable,  revealed  no  impact  on  payment patterns that would require recognition of credit loss. Although the Organization's buildings were utilized to a much lower extent in 2020 than in 2019, no impairment was considered necessary for these long-term assets. For the Organization's liabilities, the most noticeable consequence of the pandemic was an increase of 5.8 million Swiss francs in the accumulated annual leave liability, largely due to the impact of staff not taking their planned leave entitlements in 2020 as a result of travel limitations. Due to these limitations, as an exceptional measure for 2020, the Organization increased the maximum annual accrual and carry-forward balance for annual leave.

At  the  end  of  2020,  the  Organization  achieved  investment  gains  of  33.4  million  Swiss  francs.  Global  financial markets reacted strongly to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in February and March 2020. Volatility increased while asset prices witnessed one of the worst and most rapid drawdowns in history. The recovery was equally quick, following the swift and substantial response to the crisis from governments and monetary authorities. Markets had mostly normalized when the potential rollout of a vaccine in 2021 was announced in November 2020, which ignited a strong rally in asset prices. Most investment categories ended the year with positive returns and WIPO portfolio returns significantly exceeded their long term targets. It is important to note that WIPO's investment strategy for its core cash and strategic cash portfolios is based on long-term fundamentals and is designed to resist periods of financial turbulence.

## Financial Performance 2020

The Organization's results for 2020 showed a surplus for the year of 135.9 million Swiss francs, with total revenue of 468.3 million Swiss francs, total expenses of 365.8 million Swiss francs, and investment gains of 33.4 million Swiss francs. This can be compared to a surplus of 97.7 million Swiss francs in 2019, with total revenue of 457.0 million Swiss francs, total expenses of 401.4 million Swiss francs, and investment gains of 42.1 million Swiss francs. The  Program  and  Budget  result  for  2020  prepared  on  a  modified  accrual  basis  (i.e.  not  including  all  IPSAS adjustments) was a surplus of 168.5 million Swiss francs. The 2020 result for the Organization under IPSAS includes Special Accounts, Projects financed from reserves, and the impact of adjustments related to full accrual accounting in accordance with IPSAS:

The chart below summarizes the principal differences between the Program and Budget surplus of 168.5 million Swiss francs, and the surplus for the whole Organization prepared on an IPSAS basis of 135.9 million Swiss francs:

Movement from budget result to IPSAS result 2020

The WIPO financial statements as prepared in accordance with IPSAS include all areas and activities of the whole Organization.  The inclusion of the results before IPSAS adjustments of Projects financed from reserves (deficit of 10.2 million Swiss francs) and Special Accounts (surplus of 3.6 million Swiss francs) represent 'entity differences' between the budget result and the surplus per the IPSAS financial statements. The application of full accrual basis accounting in accordance with IPSAS leads to a number of 'accounting basis differences' which impact the result for the year. The net impact of these adjustments is a 26.0 million Swiss francs reduction in the surplus. The principal accounting differences include:

-  the depreciation expense of buildings and equipment and the amortization expense of intangible assets as the cost of these assets is spread over their useful lives;
-  adjustments  to  reflect  movements  in  employee  benefit  liabilities  based  on  IPSAS  compliant  calculations, including those prepared by external actuaries;
-  the capitalization of costs relating to the improvement of buildings and the acquisition of equipment, along with losses from the disposal or demolition of fixed assets.

## Revenue

Composition of 2020 revenue on an IPSAS basis (in millions of Swiss francs)

<!-- image -->

Total revenue of the Organization for 2020 was 468.3 million Swiss francs, representing an increase of 2.5 per cent compared to the 2019 total revenue of 457.0 million Swiss francs. The largest source of revenue during 2020 was PCT system fees, accounting for 76.6 per cent of total revenue. Revenue from PCT system fees rose by 6.1 per cent compared to 2019.

Madrid system fees were the second largest source of revenue during the year 2020, representing 16.3 per cent of total revenue. Revenue from Madrid system fees fell by 0.8 per cent compared to 2019. Hague system fees, Lisbon system fees, assessed contributions, voluntary contributions (contributions by donors to Special Accounts) and other revenue (publications, arbitration and mediation and other/miscellaneous revenue) comprise the remaining 7.1 per cent of the Organization's total revenue. The following table provides a summary of the changes by revenue type compared to the prior year:

PCT revenue is principally comprised of international filing fees (the basic fee, plus supplementary page fees, less reductions for e-filings and least developed countries). The total PCT system fees revenue figure also comprises other fees (including handling and transfer fees) and foreign exchange gains and losses:

In accordance with IPSAS, revenue from Madrid fees for registrations, renewals and subsequent designations is recognized in the financial statements upon publication. Revenue from registrations and renewals as recognized in accordance with IPSAS has moved in line with the number of registrations and renewals in the year. Between 2019 and 2020, the number of registrations fell from 64,118 to 62,062. However, in the same period the number of renewals rose from 29,136 to 32,731:

Revenue from Hague system fees totaled 6.7 million Swiss francs for 2020, representing an increase of 26.4 per cent compared to the 2019 figure of 5.3 million Swiss francs. Registrations under the Hague system rose from 5,042 in 2019 to 6,795 in 2020. Lisbon system fees totaled 7,000 Swiss francs in 2020, compared to 14,000 Swiss francs in 2019.

Revenue from assessed contributions of 17.6 million Swiss francs in 2020 represents 3.8 per cent of total revenue, while  revenue  from  voluntary  contributions  of  5.8  million  Swiss  francs  in  2020  represents  1.2  per  cent  of  total revenue.  Revenue  from  voluntary  contributions  fell  by  46.8  per  cent  compared  to  the  prior  year.  Voluntary contributions in 2020 were received under Special Accounts, for which revenue is recognized as work is performed and expense incurred in line with the relevant agreement. Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, lower than anticipated expenses have been incurred which in turn has reduced the recognition of revenue in 2020. The actual receipt of voluntary contributions in 2020 was more in line with the prior year, totaling 9.4 million Swiss francs compared to 10.1 million Swiss francs in 2019.

Arbitration and mediation revenue of 2.1 million Swiss francs was up by 0.1 million Swiss francs on the prior year, while  publications  revenue  of  0.5  million  Swiss  francs  was  0.2  million  Swiss  francs  higher  than  in  2019. Other/miscellaneous revenue totaled 0.8 million Swiss francs in 2020, compared to 6.3 million Swiss francs in 2019. The higher amount in 2019 was mainly the result of the reversal of unused provisions for legal costs.

The Organization's expenses decreased in nearly all areas compared to 2019. The most significant reduction was for travel, training and grants, which fell from 17.5 million Swiss francs in 2019 to 1.8 million Swiss francs in 2020. This  89.7  per  cent  decrease  was  a  direct  consequence  of  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the Organization's activities, with restrictions over movement and mass gatherings significantly impacting travel for missions and physical participation in conferences and meetings.

The Organization's personnel expenditure comprises principally net base salary and post adjustments for staff in posts or temporary positions. Combined these represent 144.8 million Swiss francs, 62.0 per cent of total personnel expenditure for 2020. Total personnel expenditure in 2020 of 233.7 million Swiss francs has decreased by 8.8 per cent compared to total personnel expenditure of 242.5 million Swiss francs in 2019. Several factors have contributed to this decrease. The total of net base salary and post adjustments of 144.8 million Swiss francs was 3.1 million Swiss  francs  lower  than  the  2019  figure.  The  impact  of  movements  in  long-term  employee  benefit  liabilities recognized through personnel expenditure was also 2.5 million Swiss francs lower in 2020 than in 2019. In addition, the cost of staff termination agreements fell by 2.7 million Swiss francs compared to the prior year. The cost of internships  and  WIPO  fellowships,  which  is  not  included  as  part  of  personnel  expenditure,  increased  slightly compared to 2019, rising by 5.8 per cent to 5.5 million Swiss francs.

Contractual services in 2020 totaled 88.6 million Swiss francs. These expenses have decreased by 7.5 million Swiss francs compared to the 2019 figure. Within this, conference expenses, including interpreter remuneration, premises rental and material costs, were 3.1 million Swiss francs lower than the prior year. Individual contractual services were 2.2 million Swiss francs down on the 2019 figure, and training expenses fell by 0.5 million Swiss francs. Operating expenses in 2020 totaled 20.9 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 7.1 per cent compared to the 2019

total  of  22.5 million  Swiss  francs.  Notably  communication expenses, including postage costs, fell by 0.8 million Swiss francs against the 2019 figure. Expenses for equipment and supplies fell from 6.4 million Swiss francs in 2019 to 5.3 million Swiss francs in 2020, and depreciation and amortization of capitalized fixed assets were also lower than in the prior year, totaling 9.8 million Swiss francs, compared to a charge of 10.2 million Swiss francs in 2019.

## Financial Position 2020

As at December 31, 2020, the Organization had net assets of 387.1 million Swiss francs, with total assets of 1,390.9 million Swiss francs and total liabilities of 1,003.8 million Swiss francs. During 2020, the Organization's net assets increased by 22.9 million Swiss francs. The surplus for the year of 135.9 million Swiss francs was largely offset by actuarial losses related to WIPO's liability for ASHI, which totaled 114.9 million Swiss francs and were recognized through net assets. A revaluation gain of 1.9 million Swiss francs on land owned by the Organization was also recognized through net assets:

## Assets

At the end of 2020 the Organization held cash, cash equivalents and investment balances of 932.0 million Swiss francs,  representing  67.0  per  cent  of  total  assets.  This  included  amounts  totaling  186.0  million  Swiss  francs classified  as  restricted,  and  amounts  totaling  211.2  million  Swiss  francs  representing  strategic  cash  and investments. The total balance of 932.0 million Swiss francs was 177.9 million Swiss francs higher than the balance of 754.1 million Swiss francs at the end of 2019.

The Organization holds significant fixed assets (land, buildings, intangible assets and equipment) with a total net book value of 382.5 million Swiss francs. During 2020, costs totaling 1.8 million Swiss francs for additions and improvements to existing buildings were capitalized, and equipment acquisitions of 0.9 million Swiss francs were capitalized. The total depreciation and amortization charge against all fixed assets was 9.8 million Swiss francs for 2020.

Other  assets  of  the  Organization  totaling  76.4  million  Swiss  francs  included  accounts  receivable  and  advance payments. Within this, the most significant balance was PCT debtors totaling 53.1 million Swiss francs. At any given time, a significant number of PCT applications have been filed with receiving Offices and possibly received by WIPO, for which no corresponding fee payment has yet been received by the Organization. The balance of PCT debtors decreased  compared  to  the  prior  year,  when  it  totaled  59.1  million  Swiss  francs.  Although  PCT  applications increased in 2020, the percentage of unpaid applications at year end fell compared to the prior year, from 16.5 per cent to 13.9 per cent of filings in the year.

## Liabilities

Employee benefit liabilities of 495.3 million Swiss francs were mainly comprised of the ASHI liability of 452.8 million Swiss francs, representing 91.4 per cent of the total employee benefits liability as at December 31, 2020. The ASHI liability increased by 139.1 million Swiss francs compared to the 2019 balance. The calculation of the ASHI liability is performed by an independent actuary. In accordance with IPSAS requirements, the ASHI liability recognized in the financial statements represents the present value of all expected future benefits to existing retirees and their dependents, and all accrued post-employment benefits of active staff. On average, medical costs increase with age, so the most significant expected medical costs remain to be paid in the future. To manage the cost and risk of its collective medical insurance plan, WIPO has secured an insurance contract that allows a level per person premium to be paid for existing retirees and active staff, thus reducing the cash paid on behalf of older retirees relative to their incurred medical cost.

The ASHI liability calculation incorporates a number of actuarial  assumptions. These include the discount rate, medical cost trend rates, age-grading for medical claims, retirement rates and mortality rates. Changes to these assumptions year on year lead to actuarial gains and losses which are recognized as part of the liability in the Statement of Financial Position. A breakdown of the movement in the liability due to actuarial gains and losses is provided  in  Note  10  of  these  financial  statements.  The  increase  in  the  liability  in  2020  was  mainly  due  to  a modification of the expected future age-related medical costs. The ASHI liability is the ultimate cost of providing future post-employment medical costs, derived from the medical insurance premiums by applying an age-specific grading factor based on an analysis of recent claims data which has led to changes and increases at certain age groups.  This  is  different  from  considering  only  the  medical  insurance  premiums,  which  are  mitigated  by  lower expected costs for the younger staff and new joiners.

Other changes to actuarial assumptions included a further lowering of the discount rate from 0.50 per cent to 0.30 per cent, which also led to an increase in the liability. This was partly offset by a decrease in the medical cost trend rate from 3.00 per cent to 2.90 per cent. The following graph shows how the ASHI liability has developed since 2016, and includes actuarial forecasts for 2021-2024 (applying the same assumptions as for the 2020 calculation). The graph also shows how discount rates and medical cost trend rates have changed since 2016:

Movement in ASHI liability 2016-2024

<!-- image -->

The projections of the ASHI liability for 2021-2024 do not consider gains or losses from possible future changes in actuarial assumptions, which could significantly impact calculations in subsequent years. The projected increase in the liability for 2021-2024 reflects the demographic make-up of participants in WIPO's collective medical insurance plan.  Projected  additional  ASHI  benefits  accrued  by  active  staff  (which  increase  the  ASHI  liability)  outweigh projected medical costs paid to retirees (which reduce the ASHI liability).

As at December 31, 2020, payables and advance receipts totaled 435.3 million Swiss francs, and mainly included deferred revenue for the processing of international applications (under the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems) for 289.1 million Swiss francs. This deferred revenue balance principally concerns PCT system fees of 286.1 million Swiss francs. Revenue from fees relating to the processing of international applications is deferred until the related application is published. At any given time, a number of PCT applications will have been filed with either receiving Offices or WIPO which have yet to be published. As at December 31, 2020, for applications with a 2019 or 2020 filing date, it is estimated that approximately 206,528 applications were unpublished. At the end of the prior year 2019, approximately 202,932 applications filed in 2018 or 2019 were unpublished and the deferred revenue balance for PCT system fees was 281.8 million Swiss francs.

## Cash Flow 2020

The Organization's cash, cash equivalents and investments balance has continually increased over the last ten years. A further significant increase of 177.9 million Swiss francs was achieved in 2020. This included fair value increases of 21.5 million Swiss francs on the Organization's medium-term investment portfolio, and 11.7 million Swiss francs on the Organization's long-term investment portfolio. The principal cash inflows to the Organization are payments of PCT system fees. Monthly cash inflows from PCT system fees averaged 30.7 million Swiss francs during the year 2020 compared to 29.3 million Swiss francs during the year 2019. The Organization generally holds its cash deposits in instant access bank accounts. During 2020 the Organization continued to hold balances in term deposit accounts (for periods up to 12 months). This has allowed the Organization to reduce the level of charges on certain instant access bank accounts following the introduction of negative interest rates during 2015.

As at December 31, 2020, WIPO's medium-term investment portfolio (core cash investments) had a fair value of 471.7 million Swiss francs, and the long-term investment portfolio (strategic cash investments) had a fair value of 200.6 million Swiss francs. WIPO's non-current investments are held at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position. Fair value increases in these investment portfolio assets during 2020, as noted above, reflect short term market volatility. Core cash balances are invested with the objective of generating a positive return over rolling five year periods, and strategic cash balances are invested over the long term. WIPO's investments generated dividends of 4.9 million Swiss francs during 2020.

Cash, cash equivalents and investments can be presented separately between unrestricted, restricted and strategic cash  balances.  There  are  several  elements  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  which  are  classified  as  restricted. Restricted  cash  includes  current  accounts  held  for  third  parties  (applicants  under  the  PCT,  Madrid  and  Hague systems, and also certain contracting parties), fees collected on behalf of contracting parties, deposits received in

connection  with  pending  procedures  related  to  trademarks,  and  Special  Accounts  held  on  behalf  of  donors  of voluntary contributions. Strategic cash represents the funds held by the Organization which have been allocated for the future financing of after-service employee benefit liabilities, including ASHI. The balance of strategic cash was 211.2 million Swiss francs as at December 31, 2020. This comprised the long-term investment portfolio (including unrealized gains) of 200.6 million Swiss francs, and cash balances yet to be invested of 10.6 million Swiss francs. These balances included the additional amounts generated in 2020 from the Program and Budget charge applied to the cost of posts for the funding of after-service employee benefit liabilities.

## ANNUAL STATEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

## December 31, 2020

## Scope of responsibility

As Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), I am accountable, in accordance with the responsibility assigned to me, in particular, by Regulation 5.8 (d) of the Financial Regulations and Rules (FRRs), for maintaining a system of internal financial control that ensures:

- (i) the  regularity  of  the  receipt,  custody  and  disposal  of  all  funds  and  other  financial  resources  of  the Organization;
- (ii) the conformity of obligations and expenditures with appropriations or other financial provisions approved by the General Assembly or with the purposes and rules relating to specific trust funds;
- (iii)  the effective, efficient and economic use of the resources of the Organization.

In signing this statement, I rely also on assurance, as detailed below, provided by the former Director General for the period January 1 to September 30, 2020, Deputy Directors General and Assistant Directors General in office in 2020, the Organization's assurance functions and information provided to me in the WIPO Assurance Summary.

## Purpose of the system of internal control

Our  system  of  internal  control  is  a  process,  effected  by  the  Governing  Bodies,  the  Director  General,  senior management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance of the Organization's ability to reach its aims, objectives and related policies.  The aim of this system of internal control is to manage risk to a tolerable level rather than to eliminate it entirely. As such, it sets out to provide reasonable assurance over the:

Reliability of financial reporting - transactions authorized and properly recorded and material errors or irregularities are either prevented or detected in a timely manner;

Effectiveness and efficiency of processes, the safeguarding of assets and the exercise of economy;  and Compliance with WIPO's regulatory framework and any other applicable rules and regulations.

This Statement  is presented in line with the  seven  components  of  WIPO's  Accountability  Framework (WO/PBC/29/4), which itself is aligned to the COSO framework and Three Lines Model.

My  current  statement  on  WIPO's  internal  control  processes,  as  described  above,  applies  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2020, and up to the date of the approval of the Organization's 2020 financial statements.

## 1. Results based planning

Resource needs are driven by the substantive work program planned for implementation during a biennium, in accordance with the Medium Term Strategic Plan (MTSP).  Member States' approval of the 2020/21 Program and Budget sets the implementation parameters for the biennium, and control processes centered on the WIPO FRRs ensure that WIPO Programs are implemented in accordance with those approvals.

Annual workplanning, implementation and monitoring are controlled via a suite of enterprise resource management tools and appropriate work processes throughout the biennium.

## 2. Performance and risk management

The year represented a period of significant uncertainty and disruption globally.  In order to provide assurance publicly, WIPO published monthly crisis management dashboards on its website. Despite the disruptions, income was higher than forecasted, and this demonstrates to some extent, the resilience of the global IP ecosystem.  At the organizational level, I chaired the Crisis Management Team and the Risk Management Group. These structures work together to manage the Organization's overall risk portfolio as outlined in the WIPO Risk Appetite Statement, in the context of the global health and economic crisis.  Critical risks and appropriate responses were reviewed regularly. These include the following key risks that we faced in 2020 and beyond:

##  Program Delivery Risk

The Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions related to on-site presence, travel and meetings placed severe pressure on some Programs to deliver planned activities.

Control and mitigation:  Our Global IP Systems continued to operate almost seamlessly with productivity indicators for PCT, Madrid and the Hague all at 98% or above by December 2020.  However, those of WIPO's Programs that are largely dependent on traditional, in-person implementation modalities for the holding of meetings and capacity building events continued to be significantly impacted by the pandemic. These Programs have adapted their content and delivery methods in order to respond to the temporary constraints caused by the pandemic.

-  Financial Risk

Particularly in light of the Covid-19 situation, the risk that revenue would be lower than initially forecast, or that the value of some investments made under the investment strategies for operating, core and strategic cash pools could decrease, was exacerbated.

Control and mitigation:  Filing numbers continued to remain resilient throughout 2020 with the Organizational income correspondingly  strong.    There  was  a  significant  planned  'buffer'  between  forecast  revenue  and  planned expenditure.    Investments  continued  to  be  under  close  review  and  oversight  by  the  Advisory  Committee  on Investments  with  the  assistance  of  independent  investment  advisors  throughout  the  year  and  through  monthly reporting to the IAOC.

-  Cyber Risk

WIPO is exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks, potentially more so during remote working modalities, and the risk of malicious  or  accidental  breach  of  data  leading  to  unauthorized  disclosure  or  misuse  of  WIPO's  confidential information, or disruption of business operations remained.

Control and mitigation:  WIPO continues to implement a number of phased fit-for-purpose information assurance strategies across governance, people, processes and technologies, to strengthen its information security posture and its resilience against evolving cyber security threats.

-  Strategic Risk

Risk that WIPO's Global IP services fail to keep pace and remain the best value option for IP protection, or the perceived  value  of  IP  protection  declines,  in  the  context  of  a  rapidly  changed  global  economic,  political  and technological landscape, including from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Control and mitigation: WIPO will engage and communicate more effectively around the world on IP and connect it more clearly to the improvement of lives and livelihoods,  and more broadly, to its power as a tool to catalyze economic and societal benefits. To ensure that our services continue to bring value to users, we will continue to scan, understand and use emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, block chain, digital time stamping and digital media in improving our services.

## 3. Monitoring, Oversight, Complaints and Response Mechanisms

As Director General of WIPO, I am ultimately accountable for the effectiveness of the system of internal controls. My assertion is supported and informed by:

-  A statement on internal control from the former Director General, referring to the period January 1 to September 30, 2020 which has been reviewed by me and the Risk Management Group and is supported by Management Representation Letters (MRL);
-  The Deputy Directors General and Assistant Directors General in office in 2020, who have signed MRLs from which I derive assurance.  These letters recognize their responsibility for having and maintaining, in the Sectors for  which  they  were  responsible,  well-functioning  systems  and  a  mechanism  for  internal  control  aimed  at preventing and/or detecting instances of fraud and major errors;
-  The Risk Management Group (RMG) whose purpose is to promote a culture of responsible risk management in WIPO and reviews and monitors WIPO's financial situation, the key risks to the achievement of Expected Results and this present Statement together with the evidence that supports it;
-  The Chief Ethics Officer, who is accountable for ensuring the design, development and implementation of an effective  Ethics  program  to  enhance  integrity,  compliance with  ethics  rules,  and the  ethical  conduct  of  the Organization's  business.  WIPO's  Code  of  Ethics,  and  policies  on  Financial  Disclosure  and  Declaration  of Interests, Protect Against Retaliation for Reporting Misconduct and for Cooperating with Duly Authorized Audits or Investigations further contribute to setting the right tone in this area;
-  The Internal Oversight Division (IOD), on whose assurance and advisory services I rely, through reports of internal audit and evaluation as well as management implication reports resulting from investigations.  These reports include recommendations, independent and objective observations on the efficiency and effectiveness

of  the  Organization's  system  of  internal  controls  and  risk  management  processes,  as  well  as  program performance, and other related activities of  oversight;

-  The Independent Advisory Oversight Committee (IAOC), which is an external expert advisory body that assists member states with oversight of WIPO's operations. Its mandate includes the promotion of internal controls, reviewing the effectiveness and operational independence of the internal oversight function, and reviewing and advising on the ethics function;
-  The Joint Inspection Unit of the United Nations System, which is mandated to conduct evaluations, inspections and investigations system-wide;
-  The External Auditor, whose audit aims to provide independent assurance to Member States, to add value to WIPO's  financial  management  and  governance,  and  to  support  its  objectives  through  the  external  audit process;  and
-  The Governing Bodies' observations.

I  further  ensure  that  Feedback  Mechanisms  are  in  place  for  Member  States,  Customer  Complaint  Resolution Services are in place for clients and that Informal and Formal Conflict Resolution Mechanisms are in place for staff.

## 4. Control Activities

Over 380 Process Level Controls are management controls that ensure the effective and efficient functioning of end-to-end business processes and the compliance with the Organization's regulatory framework.  These controls are assessed annually for strength, in particular their maturity, automation and level of documented evidence.  The results are reported to the RMG and the IAOC in the WIPO Assurance Summary.

During 2020, the Organization largely moved to a virtual working environment as a result of the Covid pandemic. Control activities continued to be undertaken in the virtual environment as previously, ensuring the robust control environment was maintained.  However, over the course of the year, some controls were digitalized or otherwise modified,  for  example,  electronic  signatures  in  place  of  hand  written  authorization.  We  continued  to  make improvements the system of assurance including the development of a strategy that defines the increased use of data  analytics  for  internal  controls  as  well  as  an  increased  identification  of  internal  controls  in  the  areas  of Information Security, Information Technology, Enterprise Solutions, and Staff Development.  Looking forward, we anticipate initiating implementation of the above strategy and a focus on control assessments for External Offices.

## 5. Information and Communication

The RMG is kept informed of risks and controls through access to our business intelligence system.  Quarterly risk reports and annual risk management reports take stock of the evolving situation periodically.  External specialist risk intelligence provides independent advice to ensure a comprehensive view, and internally, an annual survey to senior staff tests their level of confidence in accountability systems at WIPO.

A robust Information and Data Governance Framework is in place reflecting its importance to WIPO.  A Master Data Management Policy provides a directive control for managing critical data and provides an authoritative point of reference for integration into the enterprise architecture.  An information classification and handling policy provides a preventive control raising understanding and application of levels of information confidentiality.

The portfolio of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions provide a high level of control, including transactional level  system  controls  and  data  analytics.    The  Enterprise  Risk  Management  solution  ensures  controls  are systematically  owned,  assessed  and  as  appropriate  linked  to  risks.    The  annual  WIPO  Performance  Report presented to Member States includes a review of the evolution and impact of risks on the delivery of Expected Results for each Program.

## 6. Ethical Standards and Integrity

The conduct and actions of WIPO staff must always adhere to the highest ethical standards, as set out in the WIPO Code of Ethics.  Ethics training is provided to all staff through the Ethics Office and fraud awareness training has been completed by over 96 per cent of staff.

WIPO  has  in  place  Organization-wide  anti-fraud  controls,  in  accordance  with  good  practices  and  applicable international standards, based on risk assessments.  Appropriate fraud prevention, detection, response and data collection  procedures  and  processes  exist  in  the  Organization,  reflecting  WIPO's  comprehensive  anti-fraud governance framework.

WIPO's  Policy  on  Financial  Disclosure  and  Declaration  of  Interests  aims  to:    (i)  promote  transparency  and accountability; (ii) enhance internal and external public trust in the integrity of the Organization;  and (iii) assist the Organization to manage the risk of actual and perceived conflicts of interest through disclosure, mitigation and prevention.

## 7. Control Environment

Forty Entity Level Controls represent the overarching controls that help define the Organization's culture, and its commitment to ethical values, competence and accountability.

The Organization's regulatory framework is kept under review, as external and internal factors change, it is revised with the endorsement of Member States.  WIPO's procurement policy and procedures include a robust delegation model for procurement authority as well as additional controls and reporting.  A Vendor Sanctions policy and a Code of Conduct for Staff Involved in Procurement actions represent important control processes.

WIPO's Core Values are expressed as 'Shaping the Future', 'Acting Responsibly', 'Delivering Excellence' and 'Working as One', and all contribute to fostering a culture of accountability and strong ethical values.

## Conclusion

Based on the contents of this statement and the evidence that underpins it, I conclude that, to the best of my knowledge  and  information,  there  have  been  no  material  weaknesses  that  would  affect  the  reliability  of  the Organization's financial statements, nor are there significant matters arising which would need to be raised in the present document for the period covered.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

## to the General Assembly of the World Intellectual Property Organization

## Opinion on financial statements

I  have  audited  the  financial  statements  of  the  World  Intellectual  Property  Organization  for  the  year  ended  31 December  2020,  which  comprise  the  statement  of  financial  position,  the  statement  of  financial  performance, statement of changes in net assets, statement of cash flow, the statements of comparison of budget and actual amounts for the year then ended, and the related notes, including the significant accounting policies.

In my opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the World Intellectual Property Organization as at 31 December 2020 and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Public Sector Accounting Standards.

## Opinion on regularity

In my opinion, in all material respects, the revenue and expenses have been applied to the purposes intended by the General Assembly and the financial transactions conform to the Organization's Financial Regulations.

## Basis for opinion(s)

I conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the Organization's Financial Regulations. My responsibilities under these are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report.

The ISAs require me and my staff to comply with the Financial Reporting Council's Revised Ethical Standard 2016. I am independent of the World Intellectual Property Organization in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the financial statements. My staff and I have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinions.

## Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises information included in the Annual Financial Report and the Statement on Internal Control. My opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with my audit of the financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities  of  Management  and  Those  Charged  with  Governance  for  the  financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In  preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the World Intellectual Property Organization's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless  management  either  intends  to  liquidate  the  World Intellectual Property Organization or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those  charged  with  governance  are  responsible  for  overseeing  the  World  Intellectual  Property  Organization's financial reporting process.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

My responsibilities are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:

-  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
-  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit to design audit procedures that are appropriate in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the World Intellectual Property Organization's internal control;
-  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management;
-  conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the World Intellectual Property Organization's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the World Intellectual Property Organization to cease to continue as a going concern; and
-  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and  whether  the  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that achieves fair presentation.

In addition, I am required to obtain evidence sufficient to give reasonable assurance that revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements have been applied to the purposes intended by the General Assembly and the financial transactions confirm to the Financial Regulations which govern them.

I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

## Report

I have also issued a long-form audit report on the results of my audit.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Note 1: Objectives and Budget of the Organization

WIPO functions in accordance with the WIPO Convention signed in Stockholm on July 14, 1967 and as amended on September 28, 1979. WIPO was recognized as a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1974. WIPO is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and enjoys privileges and immunities as granted under the 1947 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies of the United Nations and the 1970 Headquarters Agreement with the Swiss Federal Council, notably being exempt from paying most forms of direct and indirect taxation. WIPO also has external offices in Abuja, Algiers, Beijing, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore and Tokyo, along with a coordination office in New York.

WIPO promotes innovation and creativity for the economic, social and cultural development of all countries, through a  balanced  and  effective  international  intellectual  property  system. WIPO's  broad-ranging  activities  include  the following  main  areas  of  work:  providing  intellectual  property  services  through  the  Organization's  Global  IP systems;  developing and maintaining the technical infrastructure that not only supports the international IP system, but  also  provides  access  to  its  outputs,  enhances  data  flows,  and  enables  global  cooperation;   serving  as  a multilateral forum for discussions on the normative development of intellectual property policy;  and facilitating the use  of  IP  for  social,  cultural  and  economic  development,  by  mainstreaming  development  considerations  and delivering development cooperation activities horizontally across all of the Organization's programs.

WIPO is funded from fees derived from services provided by the Organization, assessed contributions paid by its Member States, and voluntary contributions from Member States and other donors. The Organization operates within  the  framework  of  a  biennial  program  and  budget  which  provides  the  appropriations  that  constitute  the budgetary expenditure authorizations  approved by the Assemblies for the financial period. The approval of the appropriations  provides the  authority  for  the  Director  General  to  commit  and  authorize  expenses  and  to make payments for the purposes assigned within the limits of the appropriations.

## Note 2: Significant Accounting Policies

## Basis of Preparation

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and comply with International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The financial statements are presented in Swiss francs, which is the reporting and functional currency of WIPO, and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand. The accounting policies have been applied consistently to all years presented.

The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, unless stated otherwise. The Statement of Cash Flow is prepared using the indirect method. The financial statements are prepared on an accrual and goingconcern basis.

IPSAS 42 Social Benefits , was published in January 2019 with an original implementation date of January 1, 2022. This implementation date has now been deferred to January 1, 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges it has created. It is not expected that this standard will impact the Organization's financial statements.

## Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, deposits held up to 90 days and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

## Investments

Investments  are  classified  as  current  or  non-current  assets  according  to  the  time  horizon  of  the  investment objectives. If the time horizon is less than or equal to one year, they are classified as current assets, and if it is more than one year, they are classified as non-current assets.

## Foreign Currency Transactions

The functional currency of WIPO is the Swiss franc. All transactions occurring in other currencies are translated into Swiss francs using the United Nations Operational Rates of Exchange (UNORE) which represent those prevailing at the date of the transactions. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the reporting date of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than WIPO's functional currency are recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance.

## Revenue Recognition

Revenue from exchange transactions comprising the fees charged for applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) system, the Madrid system and the Hague system is recognized at the date of publication. Revenue from  fees  received  for  applications  not  published  at  the  reporting  date  is  deferred  until  publication  has  been completed.  The  portion  of  the  PCT  application  fee  covering  the  costs  of  translation  of  non-English  language patentability reports received after publication is also deferred until the translation is completed. All other fees under the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems are recognized when the services covered by the fee have been provided. Revenue from publications is recognized upon full delivery of the goods. Revenue from Arbitration and Mediation services is recognized upon delivery of the services related to the submission of a request covered by the fee received.

Revenue  from  non-exchange  transactions  such  as  voluntary  contributions  to  Special  Accounts  supported  by enforceable  agreements  is  recognized  as  revenue  at  the  time  the  agreement  becomes  binding  unless  the agreement  includes  conditions  related  to  specific  performance  or  the  return  of  unexpended  balances.  Such agreements require initial recognition of a liability to defer revenue recognition and then revenue is recognized as the liability is discharged through performance of the specific conditions included in the agreement.

Assessed contributions are recognized as revenue at the beginning of each year of the budget period to which the assessment relates.

## Expense Recognition

Expenses are recognized as goods are received and as services are delivered.

## Receivables

Receivables from exchange transactions include fees which are charged to users of WIPO's intellectual property services through the PCT, Madrid and Hague systems. These are measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable for PCT, Madrid and Hague system fees once the international application has been filed.

Receivables from non-exchange transactions include uncollected assessed contributions. These are measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable. An allowance for non-recoverable receivables is recorded equal to the  assessed  contributions  frozen  by  action  of  the  General  Assembly  in  1989  and  1991,  plus  contributions receivable from Member States that have lost the right to vote in accordance with Article 11, paragraph 5 of the WIPO Convention.

## Property, Plant, and Equipment

Equipment is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Equipment is recognized as an asset if it has a cost of 10,000 Swiss francs or more per unit. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the Statement of Financial Performance. Heritage assets including donated works of art are not valued in the financial statements.

Land is carried at fair value as determined by an independent valuation in accordance with International Valuation Standards. Changes in fair value are recognized directly in net assets through the Revaluation Reserve Surplus. Buildings and constructions in use are valued at the cost of construction when new plus the cost of subsequent improvements, less accumulated depreciation. For the initial recognition of buildings in use as at January 1, 2010, the date of transition to IPSAS, the value when new was determined by reference to a deemed cost calculated by an external consultant and representing the value of each component at construction plus improvements existing at the initial recognition, less accumulated depreciation based upon the remaining useful life of each component. Subsequent costs of major renovations and improvements to buildings and constructions that increase or extend the future economic benefits or service potential are valued at cost.

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the full cost of property, plant, and equipment over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method. Where property, plant, and equipment is only in use for part of the year (due to acquisition, disposal or retirement during the year), depreciation is charged only for the months during which the asset  was  in  use.  The  following  ranges  of  useful  lives  are  applied  to  the  different  classes  and  components  of property, plant, and equipment:

| Class/Component                 | Estimated useful life   |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Equipment                       |                         |
| Communications and IT equipment | 5-10 years              |
| Vehicles                        | 15 years                |
| Furniture and furnishings       | 10 years                |
| Buildings                       |                         |
| Structure                       | 50-100 years            |
| Façade                          | 50 years                |
| Perimeter bollards/walls        | 20-80 years             |
| Land Improvements               | 40-50 years             |
| Roof                            | 50-60 years             |
| Floors, walls, stairways        | 50 years                |
| Flooring, wall coverings        | 20-40 years             |
| Specialist fittings             | 15-40 years             |
| Heating and ventilation         | 25-30 years             |
| Sanitary facilities             | 40 years                |
| Electrical installations        | 25-50 years             |
| Elevators                       | 40 years                |

The  carrying  values  of  property,  plant,  and  equipment  are  reviewed  for  impairment  if  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any. Any impairment loss is recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance.

## Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis on all intangible assets of finite life, at rates that will write off the cost or value of the assets over their useful lives. The useful lives of major classes of intangible assets have been estimated as follows:

| Class                         | Estimated useful life   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Software externally acquired  | 5 years                 |
| Software internally developed | 5 years                 |
| Licenses and rights           | Period of licence/right |

Acquired computer software licenses are capitalized based on costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. Software or software licenses purchased externally are recognized as an asset if they have a cost of 20,000 Swiss francs or more per unit. Costs that are directly associated with the internal development of software for use by WIPO are capitalized as intangible assets only if the recognition criteria under IPSAS 31 are met. Direct costs include the software development employee costs.

The rights to use property in the Canton of Geneva acquired by the Organization through purchase have been recognized at historic cost and are amortized over the remaining period of the grant.  The rights to use property granted by the Canton of Geneva acquired without cost, that revert back to the Canton at the end of the grant, are not valued in the financial statements.

## Financial Assets

Financial  assets  are  recognized  initially  at  fair  value,  normally  being  the  transaction  price.  The  subsequent measurement of financial  assets  depends  on  their  classification. WIPO  classifies  its  financial  assets  as  either measured at amortized cost or measured at fair value through surplus or deficit. The classification depends on WIPO's management model for the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. WIPO assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost.

## Financial Liabilities

WIPO  initially  recognizes  its  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value.  After  initial  recognition,  financial  liabilities  are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

WIPO uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. These financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.

## Employee Benefits

Liabilities are established for After-Service Health Insurance (ASHI), repatriation grants and travel, and long-term accumulated annual leave as determined by an independent actuary on an annual basis utilizing the projected unit credit methodology of valuation. For the ASHI liability, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in net assets. In addition, liabilities are established for the value of short-term accumulated annual leave, home leave not taken, overtime earned but unpaid, separation benefits, performance rewards, and for education grants payable at the reporting date that have not been included in current expenditure.

WIPO is a member organization participating in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (the Fund), which was established by the United Nations General Assembly to provide retirement, death, disability and related benefits to employees.  The  Fund  is  a  funded,  multi-employer  defined  benefit  plan.  As  specified  by  Article  3(b)  of  the Regulations of the Fund, membership in the Fund shall be open to the specialized agencies and to any other international, intergovernmental organization which participates in the common system of salaries, allowances and other conditions of service of the United Nations and the specialized agencies.

The Fund exposes participating organizations to actuarial risks associated with the current and former employees of other organizations participating in the Fund, with the result that there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating the obligation, plan assets, and costs to individual organizations participating in the Fund. WIPO and the Fund,  in  line  with  the  other  participating  organizations  in  the  Fund,  are  not  in  a  position  to  identify  WIPO's proportionate share of the defined benefit obligation, the plan assets and the costs associated with the plan with sufficient reliability for accounting purposes. Hence WIPO has treated this plan as if it were a defined contribution plan in line with the requirements of IPSAS 39 Employee Benefits. WIPO's contributions to the Fund during the financial period are recognized as expenses in the Statement of Financial Performance.

## Leases

Finance leases are recognized as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at the lower of the fair value of the leased item or the present value of the minimum lease payments at the commencement of the lease term. The finance charge is charged to surplus or deficit over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. The amount recognized as an asset is depreciated over its useful life.

Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## Provisions

Provisions are recognized when the Organization has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, whereby it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and where a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.

## Net Assets

The Organization's net assets represent the balance of its reserves, which include its Reserves (Accumulated Surpluses,  Special  Projects  Reserve  and  Revaluation  Reserve  Surplus)  and  Working  Capital  Funds.  The Organization also recognizes actuarial gains and losses directly through net assets. The Organization manages the level of its reserves in accordance with its Policy on Reserves.

The Accumulated Surpluses of the Organization represent the accumulated net result of operations in the reporting year and prior periods after the impact of IPSAS. WIPO's Policy on Reserves establishes the principles and approval mechanism for the use of reserves for one-time projects for capital improvements and exceptional circumstances. The  Special  Projects  Reserve  contains  the  appropriations  to  these  projects  financed  from  reserves,  less accumulated expenditure. The Revaluation Reserve Surplus includes the cumulative results of revaluations of the land owned by the Organization on which the New Building has been constructed. The Working Capital Funds are

established for providing advance financing of appropriations should there be a temporary liquidity shortfall, and for such other purposes as the Assemblies of Member States and of the Unions shall decide. The Working Capital Funds are financed by contributions and are held in trust by WIPO for the Member States of the respective Unions.

## Segment Reporting

Segment reporting is based upon the Unions that form WIPO. Revenue and expenses incurred by the Organization are allocated among the Unions in accordance with an allocation methodology approved by the WIPO Assembly (Program and Budget 2020/21, Annex III). The methodology allocates revenue and expenses to each program and then to each Union based on a combination of direct revenue and expense, staff head count and each Union's 'capacity to pay'. Direct Union expenses are allocated to Unions either fully or on the basis of estimates by Program Managers. Direct administrative expenses are allocated to the Unions based on relative headcount shares. Indirect Union expenses and indirect administrative expenses are allocated to the Unions based on the 'capacity-to-pay' principle.  If  the  Union  has  a  reserve  level  above  its  reserve  target, it  is  deemed  to  be  able  to  support  indirect activities. The 'capacity to pay' is calculated as the difference between a Union's projected biennial income and its direct Union and direct administrative expenses. The extent to which this support can be provided by each Union is calculated by considering the relative extent to which the Union's income exceeds its direct expenditure. The only inter-segment  charge  represents  the  costs  of  program  support  incurred  by  the  Unions  in  support  of  Special Accounts.  Program  support  costs  are  charged  to  the  Special  Accounts  based  on  a  percentage  of  total  direct expenditure  specified  in  the  agreement  with  the  donor  making  the  voluntary  contribution.  WIPO's  assets  and liabilities are not allocated to individual segments, since ownership rests with the Organization as a whole, however, each Union's share of the Organization's net assets including Reserves and Working Capital Funds is recognized by segment.

## Changes in Presentation

In the Statement of Financial Position the basis for allocating long-term employee benefit liabilities between current and non-current liabilities has been modified. Previously the current allocation was based on the expected expense in the following twelve months, and this has been changed to reflect the amounts expected to be settled in the following twelve months. This modification results in a presentation of the current portion of benefits included in the benefit obligation as it stands at the reporting date. As a result of this change, 24.2 million Swiss francs has been reallocated from current to non-current employee benefits in the 2019 comparative numbers in the Statement of Financial Position.

## Use of Estimates

The  financial  statements  necessarily  include  amounts  based  on  estimates  and  assumptions  by  management. Estimates include, but are not limited to: ASHI, repatriation grants and travel, and long-term accumulated annual leave liabilities (the value of which are calculated by an independent actuary), other employee benefit liabilities, provisions for litigation, financial risk on accounts receivable, accrued charges and the degree of impairment of fixed assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known.

All balances are presented in thousands of Swiss francs, as a result small rounding differences may occur.

WIPO has been granted surface rights by the Republic and Canton of Geneva to the land on which the Árpád Bogsch and Georg Bodenhausen buildings are located. These surface rights were acquired by the Organization at no cost and no value has been recognized in the financial statements as the Organization does not have the right to dispose of the rights.

WIPO holds fully depreciated equipment which is still in use for a gross carrying amount of 3.1 million Swiss francs. In 2020 the Organization increased the capitalization threshold for equipment from 5,000 Swiss francs to 10,000 Swiss francs. As a result, equipment with a gross carrying value of 1.9 million Swiss francs was derecognized in the  financial  statements.  The  land  upon  which  the  New  Building  was  constructed  was  initially  acquired  by  the Organization at a cost of 13.6 million Swiss francs in 1998, but is held at fair value based on International Valuation Standards as determined by an independent appraiser. An updated valuation of the land was performed by an independent appraiser at December 31, 2020. This valuation indicated a further increase in the fair value of the land of 1.8 million Swiss francs, compared to the previous valuation performed in 2019. The net result of all periodic

revaluations totalling 20.4 million Swiss francs is included in the Revaluation Reserve Surplus which forms part of WIPO's  net  assets.  Market  value  was  estimated  by  capitalizing  at  an  appropriate  investment  yield  the  future potential income stream from the property. The potential income is based on comparable rentals in the market and takes into account the quality of the spaces as well as the location. The yield has been selected by reference to the perceived quality and duration of the income and the potential for further rental growth and is cross-referenced by the evidence provided by comparable sales.

WIPO holds heritage assets, referred to as works of art, representing items donated or loaned to the Organization by representatives or officials of Member States or other public or private entities or individuals. The works of art held  by  WIPO  include  paintings,  sculptures,  decorative  objects,  historical  documents  and  other  items.  As  at December 31, 2020, the Organization held a total of 592   items classified as works of art. WIPO has elected not to recognize works of art as assets in the Statement of Financial Position, in accordance with IPSAS 17. The  592 items are classified as follows:

| Number of Works of Art      |   2020 |   2019 |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------|
| Framed artwork              |    171 |    164 |
| Sculptures                  |     78 |     75 |

| Silverware                  |     18 |     18 |

| Total                       |    592 |    567 |

Under the WIPO Policy on Property Management and the related Property Management Manual, the Organization has established processes and procedures for the management of works of art, including the final determination as to whether an item is deemed to be a work of art. Works of art are held in controlled access storage until such time as a decision is taken in relation to the placement of an item. Most of the small and fragile works of art are stored in closed cabinets.  The dedicated storage is currently being improved to enhance protection from dust and possible water damage. In addition, works of art placed in lobbies, offices and on office floors in WIPO's buildings benefit from existing security measures. All works of art are recorded in the Asset Management Module of WIPO's ERP system, and are included in the Organization's annual physical inventory process. Formal confirmations that works of art are held by WIPO are provided to donors upon request.

In 1991 the Organization entered into an agreement with the International Centre of Geneva Foundation (FCIG) related to the construction of a building on rue des Morillons in Geneva, Switzerland. The agreement provided for the Organization to advance the initial sum of 10.0 million Swiss francs, plus a further sum of 1.0 million Swiss francs representing interest on the initial advance, equaling a total advance of 11.0 million Swiss francs. In 2016 the FCIG was absorbed by law into the Foundation for Buildings for International Organizations (FIPOI).

WIPO also entered into an agreement to lease the building from FCIG (subsequently amended to FIPOI).  The current lease agreement, which was updated and signed by WIPO in 2019, includes an annual amortization charge of 188,679 Swiss francs against WIPO's advance to FIPOI. On termination of the lease, upon vacating the premises WIPO is to be repaid the balance of the 11.0 million Swiss francs advance after amortization. FIPOI will also retain 1.0 million Swiss francs from the advance for restoration of the building to its original condition.

Long-term employee benefits include After-Service Health Insurance (ASHI), repatriation grant and travel, and accumulated leave (posts). Note that the basis for allocating long-term employee benefit liabilities between current and non-current liabilities has been modified in the 2020 financial statements. Previously the current allocation was based on the expected expense in the following twelve months, and this has been changed to reflect the amounts expected to be settled in the following twelve months:

ASHI: Staff members (and their spouses, dependent children and survivors) retiring from service are eligible for After-Service Health Insurance (ASHI) coverage if they continue to participate in the collective medical insurance plan after separation from service. In accordance with WIPO's SRR, a share of 65 per cent of the monthly medical insurance premium is paid by the Organization. From January 1, 2021, monthly medical premiums amount to 596 Swiss francs for adults and 265 Swiss francs for children.

Repatriation  grant  and  travel: The  Organization  has  a  contractual  obligation  to  provide  benefits  such  as repatriation  grants,  travel  and  removal  for  certain  internationally  recruited  staff  members  at  the  time  of  their separation from service

Accumulated leave (posts): Accumulated annual leave is classified as a long-term employee benefit for staff members holding permanent, continuing or fixed term contracts. Staff in posts may normally accrue up to 15 days of annual leave in a given year, and a total accumulated balance of 60 days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, due to the COVID-19 pandemic exceptional measures were introduced to allow the accrual of up to 20 days annual leave in 2020, and a total accumulated balance of 80 days to be carried forward to 2021. On separation from service, staff in posts who have accumulated annual leave can receive a payment in lieu of an amount equivalent to their salary for the period of accumulated annual leave, up to a maximum of 60 days.

Employee benefit liabilities for ASHI, repatriation grant and travel, and accumulated leave (posts) are calculated by an independent actuary. Actuarial assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts calculated for employee benefit liabilities. A description of the factors which impact the size of the ASHI liability is included in the financial statement discussion and analysis which precedes these financial statements. The principal actuarial assumptions applied in determining these liabilities are detailed below. Discount rates were determined using AA Corporate Bond Yield Curves:

The present value of the defined benefit obligations for ASHI is determined using the projected unit credit method including discounting the estimated future cash outflows. In accordance with IPSAS the Organization's ASHI liability is considered as unfunded as no plan assets are held in a legally separate entity or fund, and therefore no plan assets are deducted from the liability as recognized in the Statement of Financial Position. However, it should be noted that the Organization has established separate funds (strategic cash) for the future financing of after-service employee benefit liabilities. The table below details the expense for ASHI recognized in the Statement of Financial Performance:

As can be seen in the table above, the most significant movement in the 2020 ASHI liability is the result of actuarial losses from changes to the medical claims age-grading factors. Consistent with the approach taken in 2019, in the 2020  actuarial  calculation  age-grading  factors  have  been  applied  to  premiums  to  derive  the  expected  future underlying medical claims costs for active staff, retirees and dependents. The 2020 age-grading factors were based on an analysis of claims data over a four-year period which led to changes in the factors compared to those applied in the prior year. No specific modifications were made to any of the 2020 actuarial assumptions, including those related to medical claims or mortality rates, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is insufficient available information to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 on these future trends . Contributions paid by the Organization for ASHI totaled 3.9 million Swiss francs for 2020 (3.7 million Swiss francs in 2019). Expected contributions to ASHI in 2021 are 4.9 million Swiss francs. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at December 31, 2020, was 23 years. The following table details the present value of the defined benefit obligation and experience adjustments on the ASHI liability for 2020 and the previous four years:

The following sensitivity analysis shows how the defined benefit obligation would have been affected by changes in significant actuarial assumptions, the discount rate and the rate of sickness premium increase. The per cent changes used in the analysis are considered reasonable based on historical movements:

## United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund

The Fund's Regulations state that the Pension Board shall have an actuarial valuation made of the Fund at least once every three years by the Consulting Actuary. The practice of the Pension Board has been to carry out an actuarial valuation every two years using the Open Group Aggregate Method. The primary purpose of the actuarial valuation is to determine whether the current and estimated future assets of the Pension Fund will be sufficient to meet its liabilities.

WIPO's financial obligation to the Fund consists of its mandated contribution, at the rate established by the United Nations General Assembly (currently at 7.9 per cent for participants and 15.8 per cent for member organizations) together with any share of any actuarial deficiency payments under Article 26 of the Regulations of the Fund. Such deficiency payments are only payable if and when the United Nations General Assembly has invoked the provision of Article 26, following determination that there is a requirement for deficiency payments based on an assessment of the actuarial sufficiency of the Fund as of the valuation date. Each member organization shall contribute to this deficiency an amount proportionate to the total contributions which each paid during the three years preceding the valuation date.

The latest actuarial valuation for the Fund was completed as at December 31, 2019, and a roll forward of the participation data as at December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 will be used by the Fund for its 2020 financial statements.

The actuarial valuation as at December 31, 2019, resulted in a funded ratio of actuarial assets to actuarial liabilities, assuming no future pension adjustments, of 144.2 per cent (139.2 per cent in the 2017 valuation). The funded ratio was 107.1 per cent (102.7 per cent in the 2017 valuation) when the current system of pension adjustments was taken into account.

After  assessing  the  actuarial  sufficiency  of  the  Fund,  the  Consulting  Actuary  concluded  that  there  was  no requirement, as at December 31, 2019, for deficiency payments under Article 26 of the Regulations of the Fund as the actuarial value of assets exceeded the actuarial value of all accrued liabilities under the plan. In addition, the market value of assets also exceeded the actuarial value of all accrued liabilities as of the valuation date. At the time of this report, the General Assembly has not invoked the provision of Article 26.

Should Article  26 be  invoked  due  to  an  actuarial deficiency,  either  during  the  ongoing operation  or  due  to  the termination of the Fund, deficiency payments required from each member organization would be based upon the proportion of that member organization's contributions to the total contributions paid to the Fund during the three years preceding the valuation date. Total contributions paid to the Fund during the preceding three years (2017, 2018 and 2019) amounted to 7,546.9 million US dollars, of which 1.77 per cent was contributed by WIPO (including participants and Organization contributions).

During 2020, WIPO contributions (including Organization contributions only) paid to the Fund amounted to 29.0 million Swiss francs (29.2 million Swiss francs in 2019). Expected contributions due in 2021 are approximately 28.1 million Swiss francs.

Membership  of  the  Fund  may  be  terminated  by  decision  of  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly,  upon  the affirmative recommendation of the Pension Board. A proportionate share of the total assets of the Fund at the date of  termination  shall  be  paid  to  the  former  member  organization  for  the  exclusive  benefit  of  its  staff  who  were participants in the Fund at that date, pursuant to an arrangement mutually agreed between the organization and the Fund. The amount is determined by the Pension Board based on an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of the Fund on the date of termination; no part of the assets which are in excess of the liabilities is included in the amount.

The United Nations Board of Auditors carries out an annual audit of the Fund and reports to the Pension Board and to  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly  on  the  audit  every  year.  The  Fund  publishes quarterly  reports  on  its investments and these can be viewed by visiting the Fund at www.unjspf.org.

The Organization collects fees on behalf of the contracting parties of the Madrid Agreement and Protocol and the Common Regulations of the Hague Agreement. The Organization's PCT International Bureau collects funds from applicants to cover the cost of payments of International Searching Authorities. In addition, the Organization collects fees to be paid directly to mediators, arbitrators or panelists for cases treated through the Arbitration and Mediation Centre. The Organization holds these funds on a temporary basis until they are transferred to the final beneficiary in accordance with the various treaties and agreements administered by the Organization.

At 31 December 2020, there are no known claims that impact WIPO. Ownership of assets is with ICC until dissolution. Upon dissolution, the division of all assets and liabilities amongst Partner Organizations shall be agreed by the Management Committee by a formula defined at that time.

WIPO is governed by the WIPO General Assembly composed of representatives of Member States party to the WIPO Convention which are members of any of the Unions. These representatives do not receive remuneration from WIPO. WIPO is managed by a Director General and by Deputy and Assistant Directors General and officers (key management personnel) who are remunerated by the Organization. The aggregate remuneration paid to key management personnel includes salaries, allowances, statutory travel and other entitlements paid in accordance with the Staff Regulations and Rules, and applicable to all staff. In addition, the Director General, Deputy Directors General  and  Assistant  Directors  General  receive  representation  allowances.  Key  management  personnel  are members of the UNJSPF to which the personnel and WIPO contribute and are also eligible for participation in the collective medical insurance plan. Key management personnel and their aggregate remuneration are detailed in the table above. There were no loans to key management personnel or to their close family members which were not available to other categories of staff. There was no other remuneration or compensation to key management personnel or to their close family members.

WIPO has no controlled entities and no interests in other entities which would require disclosure under IPSAS 3438. WIPO is a member of the UNJSPF and certain of its former staff are members of WIPO's CROMPI. WIPO has a relationship with the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) whereby the Director General of WIPO serves as Secretary General of UPOV. The office of UPOV exercises its functions in complete independence of WIPO. WIPO is responsible for providing space, personnel administration, financial administration, procurement services and other administrative support to UPOV in accordance with the terms of an agreement between WIPO and UPOV dated November 26, 1982. UPOV reimburses WIPO for the cost of such services in accordance with the terms of said agreement. In 2020 WIPO received 618 thousand Swiss francs from UPOV to cover the cost of these services. In addition, WIPO receives reimbursement of funds disbursed on behalf of UPOV.

## Note 17: Reconciliation of Statement V and Statement II

The WIPO Program  and  Budget  is  established  on  a  modified  accrual  basis  in  accordance  with  the  Financial Regulations and Rules, and is approved by the Assemblies of the Member States. WIPO's budget is adopted by the Assemblies on a biennial basis, however, separate estimates are prepared for each of the two annual periods. The  Program  and  Budget  for  the  2020/21  Biennium  established  a  budget  for  the  biennium  of  expenditure  of 768.4 million Swiss francs. The WIPO Performance Report for 2020 provides an explanation of both the changes between the original and final budget after transfers, and the material differences between the budget and the actual amounts. WIPO's budget and financial accounts are prepared using two different bases. The Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Changes in Net Assets and Statement of Cash Flow are  prepared  on  a  full  accrual  basis,  whereas  the  Statement  of  Comparison  of  Budget  and  Actual  Amounts (Statement V) is prepared on a modified accrual basis. As required by IPSAS 24, reconciliation is provided between the actual amounts on a comparable basis as presented in Statement V and the actual amounts in the financial accounts identifying separately any basis, timing and entity differences.

The Organization is exposed to certain foreign currency exchange, credit, interest rate, price and liquidity risks which arise in the normal course of its operations. This note presents information about the Organization's exposure to each of the above risks and the policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.

The Organization manages its investments in accordance with its Policy on Investments. The policy contains two specific  investment policies, one covering operating and core cash and a second one covering strategic cash. Operating cash is the cash required by the Organization to meet daily payment requirements and to ensure that an amount equivalent to the target reserves is available in liquid assets. Core cash is the balance of cash remaining once operating and strategic cash have been deducted. Strategic cash is the cash which has been set aside to finance after-service employee benefit liabilities, including ASHI.

## Fair Values

The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

-  Cash and short-term deposits, receivables from exchange transactions, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments;
-  Quoted investments (in investment funds  which  are  publicly  traded)  are  based  on  price  quotations  at  the reporting date;
-  Derivative financial instruments are based on quoted prices, adjusted for the UNORE at reporting date;
-  Loans and receivables are evaluated by the Organization based on parameters such as interest rates and risk characteristics.

For WIPO's financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date, the carrying amount is equivalent to the fair value.

## Fair Value Hierarchy

For those instruments categorized as fair value through surplus or deficit, fair values are classified according to the following hierarchy:

-  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1);
-  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (Level 2);
-  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (Level 3).

| Financial Assets and Liabilities                 | Fair Value Hierarchy   |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Cash and cash equivalents                        | Level 1                |
| Derivative assets and liabilities                | Level 2                |
| Investments arising from core and strategic cash | Level 1                |

## Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Organization if counterparties to financial instruments fail to meet their contractual  obligations,  and  it  arises  principally  from  the  Organization's  loans,  receivables,  cash  and  cash equivalents, and investments. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. For the purposes of financial reporting, WIPO calculates expected credit losses allowances associated with its financial assets.

The Organization's receivables from non-exchange transactions are almost exclusively from its Member States representing sovereign governments, and therefore risks related to credit are considered minor. An allowance has been established against the asset value of accounts receivable to reflect receivables for which payment is not anticipated in the short-term. The allowance covers amounts due from Member States that have lost the right to vote under Article 11, paragraph 5 of the WIPO Convention and contributions from least developed countries which have been frozen by action of the Assemblies in 1989 and 1991.

In accordance with the Organization's Policy on Investments, deposits may only be held with institutions with a minimum  short-term  credit  rating  of  A-2/P-2  or  a  minimum  long-term  credit  rating  of  A/A2.  Money  market investments, bonds, notes or other obligations and other fixed income products purchased directly by WIPO may only be held with institutions with a minimum short-term credit rating of A-3/P-3 or a minimum long-term credit rating of  BBB-/Baa3. Where these are acquired as shares in pooled market traded funds, at least 65 per cent of the portfolio holdings must be in Investment Grade (AAA/Aaa to BBB-/Baa3), while the balance of up to 35 per cent may be held in high yield bonds (BB+/Ba1 to C/Ca). The credit ratings attached to cash and cash equivalents and investments as at December 31, 2020, is as follows:

| Short-Term Credit Rating   | A-1+                           | A-1                            | A-2/P-2                        | Unrated (1)   | Total   |

(1) Unrated balances include cash on hand and non-current investments. Non-current investments held by WIPO are in investment funds which are not rated by credit rating agencies, but in which the underlying investments are made in accordance with WIPO's Policy on Investments.

## Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk of the Organization not being able to meet its obligations as they fall due.

The  Organization  does  not  have  significant  exposure  to  liquidity  risk  as  it  has  substantial  unrestricted  cash resources  which  are  replenished  from  the  results  of  its  operations.  The  Organization's  Policy  on  Investments requires that operating and core cash are invested in such a way to ensure the liquidity necessary to meet the Organization's cash flow requirements. Operating cash balances are invested over the short term (periods not exceeding twelve months to maturity) in low-risk asset classes which are easily liquidated at little or no cost. Core cash balances are invested with the objective of generating a positive return over rolling five year periods. Core cash balances are invested ideally in such a way that occasional access to a portion of the cash is possible. Strategic cash balances are invested over the long term, and currently have no short or medium term liquidity requirements.

## Currency Risk

The  Organization  receives  revenue  from  fees  in  currencies  and  incurs  expenses  in  currencies  other  than  its functional currency, the Swiss franc, and is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations of currency exchange rates. For PCT international filing fees, WIPO establishes equivalent amounts in currencies other than the Swiss franc, which can be reset during the year if the exchange rate between the other currency and Swiss franc is 5.0 per cent or more for more than four consecutive Fridays. The Organization is also exposed to exchange risk arising from the currency differences between amounts payable to International Searching Authorities (ISAs) pursuant to the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and amounts received by national patent offices for international search fees from applicants for international patents. The Organization also operates the WIPO Fee Transfer Service, a netting structure that reduces the exposure of PCT fee income to movements in currency exchange rates with regard to search fees.

Where investments are held in currencies other than the Swiss franc, the Organization may use derivative financial instruments to minimize the risk arising from the fluctuation of the currency of the investment  against the Swiss franc.  Investment  in  derivatives  for  speculative  purposes  is  not  permitted.  As  at  December  31,  2020,  the Organization held US dollar investments totalling 105.9 million Swiss francs. The sensitivity of these investments to exchange rate fluctuations is monitored, and derivative financial instruments are used to minimize this risk.

The Organization's contributions to the UNJSPF and its payments to ICC are made in US dollars. The Organization has a further exposure to exchange risk in connection with the cost of pensions for staff previously enrolled in the Closed Pension Fund who are now members of the UNJSPF. In addition, the Organization has external offices in Algeria, Brazil, China, Japan, Nigeria, Russia and Singapore, and a coordination office in the USA, with limited assets in local currency.

## Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of changes in market prices, including interest rates, affecting the Organization's income or the value of its financial instrument holdings.  Investment revenue in the Organization's budget for the 2020/21 Program and Budget is limited to interest on operating cash balances. The Organization does not currently use financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk.  WIPO's medium-term investment portfolio (core cash) and longterm investment portfolio (strategic cash) are subject to the risk of movements in market prices of the underlying investment  funds.  Based  on  historical  experience  for  the  investment  strategies  applied  to  these  portfolios,  the expected volatility for core cash and strategic cash is 3.40 per cent and 5.30 per cent respectively.

## Note 21: Events After the Reporting Date

WIPO's reporting date is December 31, 2020 and its financial statements were authorized for issue on the same date as the External Auditor's opinion.

There have been no material events, favourable or unfavourable, that occurred between the reporting date and the date when the financial statements were authorized for issue that would have had a material impact on these financial statements.

## Note 22: Segment Reporting

Segment reporting is presented in a format which represents the various Unions as the segments that make up WIPO. The Unions were created by the various treaties administered by WIPO.

The segment reporting  table  is  shown  on  the  next  page  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  following explanatory notes:

-  Note 1: The Madrid Union has assumed the financing of the Hague Union's contribution of 3 million Swiss francs to the IT Modernization Program of the Madrid and Hague international registration systems. The amount will be reimbursed by the Hague Union to the Madrid Union as soon as the level of reserves of the Hague Union Reserve Fund so allows.
-  Note 2: In accordance with the decision of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO at their 55 th  Series of Meetings in 2015, the Contribution-financed Unions assumed the financing of the deficit of the Lisbon Union in the biennium 2016/17 amounting to 56,157 Swiss francs. The amount will be reimbursed by the Lisbon Union to the Contribution-financed Unions as soon as the level of reserves of the Lisbon Union so allows.
-  Note 3: In accordance with the decision of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO at their 57th Series of Meetings in 2017: a) the Contribution-financed Unions assumed the financing of the deficit of the Lisbon Union in the biennium 2018/19 amounting to 1,662,315 Swiss francs; and b) the PCT Union assumed the financing  of  the  deficit  of  the  Hague  Union  amounting  to  18,135,044  Swiss  francs.  The  amounts  will  be reimbursed by the Lisbon Union and the Hague Union, respectively, as soon as the level of reserves of the Unions so allow.
-  Note 4: In accordance with the decision of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO at their 59th Series of Meetings in 2019: a) as the Contribution-financed Unions do not have sufficient reserves above the target to cover the deficit of the Lisbon Union amounting to 1,279,092 Swiss francs in 2020, the PCT Union has assumed the financing of the deficit of the Lisbon Union in 2020; b) the PCT Union has assumed the financing of the deficit of the Hague Union amounting to 11,024,535 Swiss francs. The amounts will be reimbursed by the Lisbon Union and the Hague Union to the PCT Union, as soon as the level of reserves of the Unions so allow.
-  Note 5: Actuarial gains/(losses) as at December 31, 2020 have been allocated based on the relative share of headcounts for 2020.
