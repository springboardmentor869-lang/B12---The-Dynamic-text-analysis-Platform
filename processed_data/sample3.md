## Artificial intelligence

Artificial  intelligence ( AI )  is  the  capability  of  computational  systems  to  perform  tasks  typically associated  with  human  intelligence,  such  as  learning,  reasoning,  problem-solving,  perception,  and decision-making.  It  is  a  field  of  research  in  computer  science  that  develops  and  studies  methods  and software  that  enable  machines  to  perceive  their  environment  and  use  learning  and  intelligence  to  take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [1]

High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation  systems  (used  by  YouTube,  Amazon,  and  Netflix);  virtual  assistants  (e.g.,  Google Assistant,  Siri,  and  Alexa);  autonomous  vehicles  (e.g.,  Waymo);  generative  and  creative  tools  (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore." [2][3]

Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. [a] To  reach  these  goals, AI  researchers  have adapted  and  integrated  a  wide  range  of  techniques,  including  search  and  mathematical  optimization, formal  logic,  artificial  neural  networks,  and  methods  based  on  statistics,  operations  research,  and economics. [b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. [4] Some  companies,  such  as  OpenAI,  Google  DeepMind  and  Meta, [5] aim  to  create  artificial  general intelligence (AGI) - AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.

Artificial  intelligence  was  founded  as  an  academic  discipline  in  1956, [6] and  the  field  went  through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, [7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding,  known  as  AI  winters. [9][10] Funding  and  interest  vastly  increased  after  2012  when  graphics processing  units  started  being  used  to  accelerate  neural  networks,  and  deep  learning  outperformed previous AI techniques. [11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. [12] In  the  2020s,  an  ongoing  period  of  rapid  progress  in  advanced  generative AI  became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms. Ethical concerns have been raised about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.

## Goals

The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [a]

## Reasoning and problem-solving

Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. [13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics. [14]

Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [15]   Even humans rarely  use  the  step-by-step  deduction  that  early  AI  research  could  model.  They  solve  most  of  their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. [16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.

## Knowledge representation

Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [17] allow AI programs to answer questions  intelligently  and  make  deductions  about real-world  facts.  Formal  knowledge  representations are  used  in  content-based  indexing  and  retrieval, [18] scene  interpretation, [19] clinical  decision  support, [20] knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable  inferences  from  large  databases), [21] and other areas. [22]

A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [23] Knowledge  bases  need  to  represent things  such  as  objects,  properties,  categories,  and relations between objects; [24] situations, events, states, and time; [25] causes and effects; [26]  knowledge about  knowledge  (what  we  know  about  what  other

An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.

people know); [27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will  remain  true  even  when  other  facts  are  changing); [28] and  many  other  aspects  and  domains  of knowledge.

Among  the  most  difficult  problems  in  knowledge  representation  are  the  breadth  of  commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [29] and the sub-symbolic form  of  most  commonsense  knowledge  (much  of  what  people  know  is  not  represented  as  "facts"  or "statements" that they could express verbally). [16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [c]

## Planning and decision-making

An  "agent"  is  anything  that  perceives  and  takes  actions  in  the  world.  A  rational  agent  has  goals  or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. [33] In  automated  decision-making,  the  agent  has  preferences-there  are  some  situations  it  would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability  that  the  outcome  will  occur.  It  can  then  choose  the  action  with  the  maximum  expected utility. [34]

In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [35] In most real-world problems,  however,  the  agent  may  not  be  certain  about  the  situation  they  are  in  (it  is  "unknown"  or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [36]

In  some  problems,  the  agent's  preferences  may  be  uncertain,  especially  if  there  are  other  agents  or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [38] The  space  of  possible  future  actions  and  situations  is  typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.

A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the  cost  of  each  action.  A  policy  associates  a  decision  with  each  possible  state.  The  policy  could  be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned. [39]

Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [40]

## Learning

Machine  learning  is  the  study  of  programs  that  can  improve  their  performance  on  a  given  task automatically. [41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [e]

There  are  several  kinds  of  machine  learning. Unsupervised  learning  analyzes  a  stream  of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without  any  other  guidance. [44] Supervised learning  requires  labeling  the  training  data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn  to  predict  what  category the  input  belongs  in)  and  regression  (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [45]

In supervised learning, the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning, the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data.

<!-- image -->

In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good". [46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new  problem. [47] Deep  learning  is  a  type  of  machine  learning  that  runs  inputs  through  biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [48]

Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization. [49]

## Natural language processing

Natural  language  processing  (NLP)  allows  programs  to  read,  write  and  communicate  in  human languages. [50] Specific  problems  include  speech  recognition,  speech  synthesis,  machine  translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering. [51]

Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense  disambiguation [f] unless  restricted  to  small  domains  called  "micro-worlds"  (due  to  the common  sense  knowledge  problem [29] ).  Margaret  Masterman  believed  that  it  was  meaning  and  not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.

Modern  deep  learning  techniques  for  NLP  include  word  embedding  (representing  words,  typically  as vectors  encoding  their  meaning), [52] transformers  (a  deep  learning  architecture  using  an  attention mechanism), [53] and others. [54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or "GPT") language models began to generate coherent text, [55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [57]

## Perception

Machine  perception  is  the  ability  to  use  input  from  sensors  (such  as  cameras,  microphones,  wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [58]

The field includes speech recognition, [59] image classification, [60] facial recognition, object recognition, [61] object tracking, [62] and robotic perception. [63]

## Social intelligence

Affective  computing  is  a  field  that  comprises  systems  that recognize, interpret,  process,  or  simulate  human  feeling, emotion, and mood. [65] For  example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously;  it  makes  them  appear  more  sensitive  to  the emotional  dynamics  of  human  interaction,  or  to  otherwise facilitate human-computer interaction.

However,  this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [66] Moderate  successes  related  to  affective  computing  include

Kismet, a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. [64]

textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. [67]

## General intelligence

A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. [68]

## Techniques

AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. [b]

## Search and optimization

AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [69] There  are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.

## State space search

State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [70] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis. [71]

Simple exhaustive searches [72] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [15] "Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [73]

Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [74]

## Local search

Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [75]

Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting  them  to  minimize  a  loss  function.  Variants  of  gradient  descent  are  commonly  used  to  train neural networks, [76] through the backpropagation algorithm.

Another  type  of  local  search  is  evolutionary  computation,  which  aims  to  iteratively  improve  a  set  of candidate  solutions  by  "mutating"  and  "recombining"  them,  selecting  only  the  fittest  to  survive  each generation. [77]

Distributed  search  processes  can  coordinate  via  swarm  intelligence  algorithms.  Two  popular  swarm algorithms  used  in  search  are  particle  swarm  optimization  (inspired  by  bird  flocking)  and  ant  colony optimization (inspired by ant trails). [78]

## Logic

Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation. [79] Formal  logic  comes  in  two  main  forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or  false  and  uses  logical  connectives  such  as  "and",  "or", "not"  and  "implies") [80] and  predicate  logic  (which  also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as " Every X is  a Y " and "There are some X s that are Y s"). [81]

Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement  (conclusion)  from  other  statements  that  are  given and  assumed  to  be  true  (the  premises). [82] Proofs  can  be structured  as  proof  trees,  in  which  nodes  are  labelled  by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.

<!-- image -->

Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the  case  of  Horn  clauses,  problem-solving  search  can  be  performed  by  reasoning  forwards  from  the premises or backwards from the problem. [83] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic,  resolution  is  a  single,  axiom-free  rule  of  inference,  in  which  a  problem  is  solved  by  proving  a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [84]

Inference  in  both  Horn  clause  logic  and  first-order  logic  is  undecidable,  and  therefore  intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming  language  Prolog,  is  Turing  complete.  Moreover,  its  efficiency  is  competitive  with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [85]

Fuzzy logic assigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [86]

Non-monotonic  logics,  including  logic  programming  with  negation  as  failure,  are  designed  to  handle default reasoning. [28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.

## Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning

Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to  operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve  these  problems  using  methods  from  probability  theory  and  economics. [87] Precise  mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision  analysis, [88] and  information  value  theory. [89] These  tools  include  models  such  as  Markov decision processes, [90] dynamic decision networks, [91] game theory and mechanism design. [92]

Bayesian  networks [93] are  a  tool that  can  be  used  for  reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [g][95] learning  (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), [h][97] planning  (using decision networks) [98] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks). [91]

Probabilistic  algorithms  can  also be  used  for  filtering,  prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations  for  streams  of  data, thus  helping  perception  systems analyze processes that occur over

time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters). [91]

## Classifiers and statistical learning methods

The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types:  classifiers  (e.g.,  "if  shiny  then  diamond"),  on one hand, and controllers (e.g., "if diamond then pick up"),  on  the  other  hand.  Classifiers [99] are  functions that  use  pattern  matching  to  determine  the  closest match.  They  can  be  fine-tuned  based  on  chosen examples  using  supervised  learning.  Each  pattern (also called an "observation") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [45]

There  are  many  kinds  of  classifiers  in  use. [100] The decision  tree  is  the  simplest  and  most  widely  used symbolic  machine  learning  algorithm. [101] K-nearest

neighbor  algorithm  was  the  most  widely  used  analogical AI  until  the  mid-1990s,  and  Kernel  methods such  as  the  support  vector  machine  (SVM)  displaced  k-nearest  neighbor  in  the  1990s. [102] The  naive Bayes  classifier  is  reportedly  the  "most  widely  used  learner" [103] at  Google,  due  in  part  to  its scalability. [104] Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [105]

## Artificial neural networks

An artificial  neural  network  is  based  on  a  collection  of  nodes  also  known  as  artificial  neurons,  which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output.

Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [105]

Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The  most  common training technique is the backpropagation  algorithm. [106] Neural  networks  learn  to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [107]

In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [108] The term perceptron typically refers to a singlelayer  neural  network. [109] In  contrast,  deep  learning  uses

A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.

<!-- image -->

many layers. [110] Recurrent  neural  networks  (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent  neural  networks  that  better  preserve  longterm  dependencies  and  are  less  sensitive  to  the vanishing  gradient  problem. [111] Convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  use  layers  of  kernels  to  more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing, where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. [112]

## Deep learning

Deep  learning  uses  several  layers  of  neurons  between  the  network's inputs  and  outputs. [110] The  multiple  layers  can  progressively  extract higher-level  features  from  the  raw  input.  For  example,  in  image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify  the  concepts  relevant  to  a  human  such  as  digits,  letters,  or faces. [114]

Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer  vision,  speech  recognition,  natural  language  processing, image  classification, [115] and  others.  The  reason  that  deep  learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [116] The  sudden  success  of  deep  learning  in  2012-2015  did  not  occur because  of  some  new  discovery  or  theoretical  breakthrough  (deep neural  networks  and  backpropagation  had  been  described  by  many

people, as far back as the 1950s) [i] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet. [j]

Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being  usually  a  word,  subword,  or  punctuation). Throughout  this  pretraining,  GPT  models  accumulate knowledge  about  the  world  and  can  then  generate  human-like  text  by  repeatedly  predicting  the  next token.  Typically,  a  subsequent  training  phase  makes  the  model  more  truthful,  useful,  and  harmless, usually  with  a  technique  called  reinforcement  learning  from  human  feedback  (RLHF).  Current  GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called "hallucinations". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [124] Such systems are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [125][126]

Current models and services include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, and Meta AI. [127] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text. [128]

## Hardware and software

In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly  designed  with  AI-specific  enhancements  and used  with  specialized  TensorFlow  software  had  replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant  means  for  large-scale  (commercial  and  academic) machine learning models' training. [129] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research, [130] but  general-purpose  programming  languages like Python have become predominant. [131]

The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to  roughly  double  every  18  months-a  trend  known  as  Moore's  law,  named  after  the  Intel  co-founder Gordon  Moore,  who  first  identified  it.  Improvements  in  GPUs  have  been  even  faster, [132] a  trend sometimes called Huang's law, [133] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang.

## Applications

AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including:

- search engines (such as Google Search)
- targeting online advertisements
- recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon) driving internet traffic
- targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook)
- virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa)
- autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars)
- automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate)
- facial recognition (Apple's FaceID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet)
- image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's Photos and TikTok).

## Health and medicine

It  has  been  suggested  that  AI  can  overcome  discrepancies  in  funding  allocated  to  different  fields  of research. [134]

AlphaFold  2  (2021)  demonstrated  the  ability  to  approximate,  in  hours  rather  than  months,  the  3D structure of a protein. [135] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [136] In 2024, researchers used machine  learning  to  accelerate  the  search  for  Parkinson's  disease  drug  treatments.  Their  aim  was  to identify  compounds  that  block  the  clumping,  or  aggregation,  of  alpha-synuclein  (the  protein  that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. [137][138]

## Games

Game playing  programs  have  been  used  since  the  1950s  to  demonstrate  and  test AI's  most  advanced techniques. [139] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. [140] In  2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. [141] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match  with  Go  champion  Lee  Sedol,  becoming  the  first  computer  Go-playing  system  to  beat  a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in  the  world. [142] Other  programs  handle  imperfect-information  games,  such  as  the  poker-playing program  Pluribus. [143] DeepMind  developed  increasingly  generalistic  reinforcement  learning  models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. [144] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. [145] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation  Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using  deep  reinforcement  learning. [146] In  2024,  Google  DeepMind  introduced  SIMA,  a  type  of  AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions. [147]

## Mathematics

Large  language  models,  such  as  GPT-4,  Gemini,  Claude,  Llama  or  Mistral,  are  increasingly  used  in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning [148] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers  for  new  problems  and  learn  from  corrections. [149] A  February  2024  study  showed  that  the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. [150]  One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. [151] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math , that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84%  accuracy  on  the  MATH  dataset  of  competition  mathematics  problems. [152] In  January  2025,

Microsoft  proposed  the  technique rStar-Math that  leverages  Monte  Carlo  tree  search  and  step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems. [153]

Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor , AlphaGeometry , AlphaProof and AlphaEvolve [154] all from Google DeepMind, [155] Llemma from EleutherAI [156] or Julius . [157]

When  natural  language  is  used  to  describe  mathematical  problems,  converters  can  transform  such prompts  into  a  formal  language  such  as  Lean  to  define  mathematical  tasks.  The  experimental  model Gemini  Deep  Think accepts  natural  language  prompts  directly  and  achieved  gold  medal  results  in  the International Math Olympiad of 2025. [158]

Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics. [159]

Topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches.

## Finance

Finance  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  sectors  where  applied AI  tools  are  being  deployed:  from  retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated "robot advisers" have been in use for some years. [160]

According to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum, it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that "the deployment of AI tools  will  simply  further  automatise  things:  destroying  tens  of  thousands  of  jobs  in banking, financial  planning,  and  pension  advice  in  the  process,  but  I'm  not  sure  it  will  unleash  a  new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation." [161]

## Military

Various countries are deploying AI military applications. [162]   The main applications enhance command and control, communications,  sensors, integration and interoperability. [163] Research  is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous  and  autonomous  vehicles. [162] AI  technologies  enable  coordination  of  sensors  and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and  deconfliction  of  distributed  Joint  Fires  between  networked  combat  vehicles,  both  human-operated and autonomous. [163]

AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine. [162][164][165][166]

## Generative AI

Generative  artificial  intelligence,  also  known  as  generative  AI  or  GenAI,  is  a  subfield  of  artificial intelligence that uses generative models to generate text, images, videos, audio, software code or other forms of data. [167] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them  to  generate  new  data [168] in  response  to  input,  which often takes the form of natural language prompts. [169][170]

The prevalence of generative AI tools has increased significantly since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made  possible  by  improvements  in  deep  neural  networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), which are based on  the  transformer  architecture.  Generative  AI  applications include chatbots such as ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek,  Google  Gemini  and  Grok;  text-to-image  models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E; and textto-video models such as Veo, LTX and Sora. [171][172][173]

Companies  in  a  variety  of  sectors  have  used  generative AI, including those in  software  development,  healthcare, [174] finance, [175] entertainment, [176] customer  service, [177] sales and marketing, [178] art, writing, [179] and product design. [180]

## Agents

AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents.  AI  agents  are  used  in  various  applications,  including  virtual  assistants,  chatbots,  autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming,  available  computational  resources,  and  hardware  limitations.  This  means  they  are restricted  to  performing  tasks  within  their  defined  scope  and  have  finite  memory  and  processing capabilities.  In  real-world  applications, AI  agents  often  face  time  constraints  for  decision-making  and action  execution.  Many  AI  agents  incorporate  learning  algorithms,  enabling  them  to  improve  their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. [181][182][183]

## Web search

Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat, as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries [184] and step-bystep reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search. [185] For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content. [186]

Google  officially  pushed  its AI  Search  at  its  Google  I/O  event  on  20  May  2025. [187] It  keeps  people looking  at  Google  instead  of  clicking  on  a  search  result.  AI  Overviews  uses  Gemini  2.5  to  provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content. [188]

## Sexuality

Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data  to  offer  predictions, [189] AI-integrated  sex  toys  (e.g.,  teledildonics), [190] AI-generated  sexual education content, [191] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika). [192] AI is

also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. [193]

AI  technologies  have  also  been  used  to  attempt  to  identify  online  gender-based  violence  and  online sexual grooming of minors. [194][195]

## Other industry-specific tasks

There  are  also  thousands  of  successful  AI  applications  used  to  solve  specific  problems  for  specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated "AI" in some  offerings  or  processes. [196] A  few  examples  are  energy  storage,  medical  diagnosis,  military logistics,  applications  that  predict  the  result  of  judicial  decisions,  foreign  policy,  or  supply  chain management.

AI applications  for  evacuation  and  disaster  management  are  growing. AI  has  been  used  to  investigate patterns  in  large-scale  and  small-scale  evacuations  using  historical  data  from  GPS,  videos  or  social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. [197][198][199]

In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide  treatments.  Agronomists  use AI  to  conduct  research  and  development. AI  has  been  used  to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.

Artificial  intelligence  is  used  in  astronomy  to  analyze  increasing  amounts  of  available  data  and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights." For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar  activity,  and  distinguishing  between  signals  and  instrumental  effects  in  gravitational  wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.

During the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages. [200]

## Ethics

AI has potential benefits and potential risks. [203] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else". [204] However, as the use of  AI has become  widespread, several unintended consequences and risks  have  been  identified. [205][206] In-production  systems  can  sometimes  not  factor ethics  and  bias  into  their  AI  training  processes,  especially  when  the  AI  algorithms  are  inherently unexplainable in deep learning. [207]

## Risks and harm

## Privacy and copyright

Machine  learning  algorithms  require  large  amounts  of  data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.

AI-powered  devices  and  services,  such  as  virtual  assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized  access  by  third  parties.  The  loss  of  privacy  is further  exacerbated  by  AI's  ability  to  process  and  combine vast  amounts  of  data,  potentially  leading  to  a  surveillance society  where  individual  activities  are  constantly  monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.

Sensitive  user  data  collected  may  include  online  activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. [208] For  example,

<!-- image -->

in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and  allowed  temporary  workers  to  listen  to  and  transcribe  some  of  them. [209] Opinions  about  this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy. [210]

AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, deidentification  and  differential  privacy. [211] Since  2016,  some  privacy  experts,  such  as  Cynthia  Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted "from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'." [212]

Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of "fair use". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for  the  copyrighted  work". [213][214] Website  owners  can  indicate  that  they  do  not  want  their  content scraped  via  a  "robots.txt"  file. [215] However,  some  companies  will  scrape  content  regardless [216][217] because the robots.txt file has no real authority. In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan  Franzen)  sued  AI  companies  for  using  their  work  to  train  generative  AI. [218][219] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors. [220]

## Dominance by tech giants

The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft. [221][222][223] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace. [224][225]

## Power needs and environmental impacts

In  January  2024,  the  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA) released Electricity  2024,  Analysis  and  Forecast  to  2026 , forecasting electric power use. [227] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional  electric  power  usage  equal  to  electricity  used  by the whole Japanese nation. [228]

Prodigious  power  consumption  by AI  is  responsible  for  the growth  of  fossil fuel use,  and  might  delay  closings  of obsolete,  carbon-emitting  coal  energy  facilities.  There  is  a

Fueled by growth in artificial intelligence, data centers' demand for power increased in the 2020s. [226]

<!-- image -->

feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft,  Meta,  Google,  Amazon)  into  voracious  consumers  of  electric  power.  Projected  electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources - from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that - in the long view - AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and "intelligent", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. [229]

A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI  Data  Centers  and  the  Coming  US  Power  Demand  Surge , found "US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation...." and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. [230] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. [231]

In  2024,  the Wall Street Journal reported  that  big AI  companies  have  begun  negotiations  with  the  US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania  nuclear-powered  data  center  for  US$650  million. [232] Nvidia  CEO  Jensen  Huang  said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. [233]

In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power - enough for 800,000 homes - of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. [234] The US  government  and  the  state  of  Michigan  are  investing  almost  US$2  billion  to  reopen  the  Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO  of Exelon who  was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation. [235]

After  the  last  approval  in  September  2023,  Taiwan  suspended  the  approval  of  data  centers  north  of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages. [236] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025. [236] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban. [236]

Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. [237] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. [237]

On  1  November  2024,  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC)  rejected  an  application submitted  by  Talen  Energy  for  approval  to  supply  some  electricity  from  the  nuclear  power  station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. [238] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. [238]

In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300-500 million  tonnes  depending  on  what  measures  will  be  taken.  This  is  below  1.5%  of  the  energy  sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it. [239]

## Misinformation

YouTube,  Facebook  and  others  use  recommender  systems  to  guide  users  to  more  content.  These  AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. [240] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. [241]  The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem. [242]

In the early 2020s, generative  AI began  to create images, audio, and  texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing, [243] while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s. [244][245][246] It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to  create  massive  amounts  of  misinformation  or  propaganda; [247] one  such  potential  malicious  use  is deepfakes  for  computational  propaganda. [248] AI  pioneer  and  Nobel  Prize-winning  computer  scientist Geoffrey  Hinton  expressed  concern  about  AI  enabling  "authoritarian  leaders  to  manipulate  their electorates" on a large scale, among other risks. [249] The ability to influence electorates has been proved in  at  least  one  study.  This  same  study  shows  more  inaccurate  statements  from  the  models  when  they advocate for candidates of the political right. [250]

AI  researchers  at  Microsoft,  OpenAI,  universities  and  other  organisations  have  suggested  using "personhood credentials" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models. [251]

## Algorithmic bias and fairness

Machine learning applications can be biased [k] if  they  learn from biased data. [253] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. [254] Discriminatory behavior by some LLMs can be observed in their output. [255] Bias  can  be  introduced  by  the  way  training  data  is  selected  and  by  the  way  a  model  is deployed. [256][253] If  a  biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination. [257] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.

On 28 June 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, [258] a problem called "sample size disparity". [259] Google "fixed" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as  a  "gorilla".  Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. [260]

COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist.  In  2016,  Julia Angwin  at  ProPublica  discovered  that  COMPAS  exhibited  racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different-the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would  re-offend  and  would underestimate  the  chance  that  a  white  person  would  not  re-offend. [261] In  2017,  several  researchers [l] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [263]

A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such  as  "race"  or  "gender").  The  feature  will  correlate  with  other  features  (like  "address",  "shopping history"  or  "first  name"),  and  the  program  will  make  the  same  decisions  based  on  these  features  as  it would on "race" or "gender". [264] Moritz  Hardt  said  "the  most  robust  fact  in  this  research  area  is  that fairness through blindness doesn't work." [265]

Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make "predictions" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations ,  some of these "recommendations"  will  likely  be  racist. [266] Thus,  machine  learning  is  not  well  suited  to  help  make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive. [m]

Bias  and  unfairness  may  go  undetected  because  the  developers  are  overwhelmingly  white  and  male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women. [259]

There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical  assumptions,  and  are  influenced  by  beliefs  about  society.  One  broad  category  is  distributive fairness,  which  focuses  on  the  outcomes,  often  identifying  groups  and  seeking  to  compensate  for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws. [252]

At  the  2022 ACM  Conference  on  Fairness, Accountability,  and  Transparency  a  paper  reported  that  a CLIP-based (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) robotic system reproduced harmful gender- and race-linked  stereotypes  in  a  simulated  manipulation  task.  The  authors  recommended  robot-learning methods  which  physically  manifest  such  harms  be  "paused,  reworked,  or  even  wound  down  when appropriate, until outcomes can be proven safe, effective, and just." [268][269][270]

## Lack of transparency

Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. [271] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are many non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist. [272]

It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned  something  different  than  what  the  programmers  intended.  For  example,  a  system  that  could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as "cancerous", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show  the  scale. [273] Another  machine  learning  system  designed  to  help  effectively  allocate  medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at "low risk" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much  more  medical  care,  they  were  relatively  unlikely  to  die  according  to  the  training  data.  The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. [274]

People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. [275] Doctors, for example,  are  expected  to  clearly  and  completely  explain  to  their  colleagues  the  reasoning  behind  any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included  an  explicit  statement  that  this  right  exists. [n] Industry  experts  noted  that  this  is  an  unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used. [276]

DARPA established the XAI ("Explainable Artificial Intelligence") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems. [277]

Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of  each  feature  to  the  output. [278] LIME  can  locally  approximate  a  model's  outputs  with  a  simpler, interpretable model. [279] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification.  These  other  outputs  can  help  developers  deduce  what  the  network  has  learned. [280] Deconvolution,  DeepDream  and  other  generative  methods  can  allow  developers  to  see  what  different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. [281] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on  dictionary learning that associates  patterns  of  neuron  activations  with  human-understandable concepts. [282]

## Bad actors and weaponized AI

Artificial  intelligence  provides  a  number  of  tools  that  are  useful  to  bad  actors,  such  as  authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.

A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. [o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. [284]  Even when used in  conventional  warfare,  they  currently  cannot  reliably  choose  targets  and  could  potentially  kill  an innocent  person. [284] In  2014,  30  nations  (including  China)  supported  a  ban  on  autonomous  weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed. [285] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots. [286]

AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face  and  voice  recognition  allow  widespread  surveillance.  Machine  learning,  operating  this  data,  can classify  potential  enemies  of  the  state  and  prevent  them  from  hiding.  Recommendation  systems  can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing  misinformation.  Advanced  AI  can  make  authoritarian  centralized  decision-making  more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital  warfare  and  advanced  spyware. [287] All  these  technologies  have  been  available  since  2020  or earlier-AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China. [288][289]

There  are  many  other  ways  in  which  AI  is  expected  to  help  bad  actors,  some  of  which  can  not  be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours. [290]

## Technological unemployment

Economists  have  frequently  highlighted  the  risks  of  redundancies  from  AI,  and  speculated  about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. [291]

In  the  past,  technology  has  tended  to  increase  rather  than  reduce  total  employment,  but  economists acknowledge  that "we're in uncharted territory" with  AI. [292] A  survey  of  economists  showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in longterm  unemployment,  but  they  generally  agree  that  it  could  be  a  net  benefit  if  productivity  gains  are redistributed. [293] Risk  estimates  vary;  for  example,  in  the  2010s,  Michael  Osborne  and  Carl  Benedikt Frey  estimated  47%  of  U.S.  jobs  are  at  "high  risk"  of  potential  automation,  while  an  OECD  report classified  only  9%  of  U.S.  jobs  as  "high  risk". [p][295] The  methodology  of  speculating  about  future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. [291] In April 2023, it was reported  that  70%  of  the  jobs  for  Chinese  video  game  illustrators  had  been  eliminated  by  generative artificial intelligence. [296][297]

Unlike  previous  waves  of  automation,  many  middle-class  jobs  may  be  eliminated  by  artificial intelligence; The Economist stated  in  2015  that  "the  worry  that AI  could  do  to  white-collar  jobs  what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously". [298] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. [299]  In July 2025, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that "artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S." [300]

From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [301]

## Existential risk

Recent  public  debates  in  artificial  intelligence  have  increasingly  focused  on  its  broader  societal  and ethical implications. It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, "spell the end of the human race". [302] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like "self-awareness" (or "sentience" or "consciousness") and becomes a malevolent character. [q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.

First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he  used  the  example  of  an  automated  paperclip  factory  that  destroys  the  world  to  get  more  iron  for paperclips). [304] Stuart  Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead." [305] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is "fundamentally on our side". [306]

Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential  risk.  The  essential  parts  of  civilization  are  not  physical.  Things  like  ideologies,  law, government,  money  and  the  economy  are  built  on  language;  they  exist  because  there  are  stories  that billions  of  people  believe.  The  current  prevalence  of  misinformation  suggests  that  an  AI  could  use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [307] Geoffrey Hinton said in 2025 that modern AI is particularly "good at persuasion" and getting better all the time. He asks "Suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the US. Do you have to go there and do it yourself? No. You just have to be good at persuasion." [308]

The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. [309] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates,  and  Elon  Musk, [310] as  well  as  AI  pioneers  such  as  Geoffrey  Hinton,  Yoshua  Bengio,  Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.

In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to "freely speak out  about  the  risks  of AI"  without  "considering  how  this  impacts  Google". [311] He  notably  mentioned risks of an AI takeover, [312] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. [313]

In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI  should  be  a  global  priority  alongside  other  societal-scale  risks  such  as  pandemics  and  nuclear war". [314]

Some  other  researchers  were  more  optimistic.  AI  pioneer  Jürgen  Schmidhuber  did  not  sign  the  joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making "human lives longer and healthier and easier." [315] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, "they can also be used against the bad actors." [316][317] Andrew Ng also argued that "it's a mistake  to  fall  for  the  doomsday  hype  on  AI-and  that  regulators  who  do  will  only  benefit  vested interests." [318] Yann LeCun ", a Turing Award winner, disagreed with the idea that AI will subordinate humans "simply because they are smarter, let alone destroy [us]", [319] "scoff[ing] at his peers' dystopian scenarios  of  supercharged  misinformation  and  even,  eventually,  human  extinction." [320] In  the  early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable  from  the  perspective  of  a  superintelligent  machine. [321] However,  after  2016,  the  study  of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research. [322]

## Ethical machines and alignment

Friendly AI  are  machines  that  have  been  designed  from  the  beginning  to  minimize  risks  and  to  make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. [323]

Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of  machine  ethics  provides  machines  with  ethical  principles  and  procedures  for  resolving  ethical dilemmas. [324] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, [324] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. [325]

Other  approaches  include  Wendell  Wallach's  "artificial  moral  agents" [326] and  Stuart  J.  Russell's  three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. [327]

## Open source

Active organizations in the  AI  open-source  community  include  Hugging  Face, [328] Google, [329] EleutherAI and Meta. [330] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight, [331][332] meaning  that  their  architecture  and  trained  parameters  (the  "weights")  are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [333] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. [334]

## Frameworks

Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows: [335][336]

- Respect the dignity of individual people
- Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively
- Care for the wellbeing of everyone
- Protect social values, justice, and the public interest

Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; [337] however,  these  principles  are  not  without  criticism,  especially  regarding  the  people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. [338]

Promotion  of  the  wellbeing  of  the  people  and  communities  that  these  technologies  affect  requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation,  and  collaboration  between  job  roles  such  as  data  scientists,  product  managers,  data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. [339]

The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with  third-party  packages.  It  can  be  used  to  evaluate  AI  models  in  a  range  of  areas  including  core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. [340]

## Regulation

The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development  of  public  sector  policies  and  laws  for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. [341] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue  in  jurisdictions  globally. [342] According  to  AI Index  at  Stanford,  the  annual  number  of  AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [343][344]  Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries  adopted  dedicated  strategies  for  AI. [345] Most  EU  member  states  had  released  national  AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi  Arabia,

The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation.

United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [345] The  Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched  in  June  2020,  stating  a  need  for  AI  to  be  developed  in  accordance  with  human  rights  and democratic  values,  to  ensure  public  confidence  and  trust  in  the  technology. [345] Henry  Kissinger,  Eric Schmidt,  and  Daniel  Huttenlocher  published  a  joint  statement  in  November  2021  calling  for  a government commission to regulate AI. [346] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [347] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. [348]  On 1 August 2024, the  EU Artificial  Intelligence Act  entered  into  force,  establishing  the  first  comprehensive  EU-wide AI regulation. [349] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the "Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of  Law".  It  was  adopted  by  the  European  Union,  the  United  States,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  other signatories. [350]

In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that "products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks". [343] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. [351] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it "very important", and an additional 41% thought it "somewhat important", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding "not very important" and 8% responding "not at all important". [352][353]

In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. [354] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of  the  summit,  calling  for  international  co-operation  to  manage  the  challenges  and  risks  of  artificial intelligence. [355][356] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. [357][358]

## History

The  study  of  mechanical  or  "formal"  reasoning  began  with philosophers  and  mathematicians  in  antiquity.  The  study  of logic  led  directly  to  Alan  Turing's  theory  of  computation, which  suggested  that  a  machine,  by  shuffling  symbols  as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [360][361] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology,  led  researchers  to  consider  the  possibility  of building  an  "electronic  brain". [r] They  developed  several areas of research that would become part of AI, [363] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for "artificial neurons" in 1943, [117] and  Turing's  influential  1950  paper  'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that "machine intelligence" was plausible. [364][361]

In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [359]  Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [359]

The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [s][6] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing": [u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [v][7] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [361]

Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating  a  machine  with  general  intelligence  and  considered  this  the  goal  of  their  field. [368] In  1965 Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". [369] In  1967  Marvin  Minsky  agreed,  writing  that  "within  a  generation  ...  the  problem  of  creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved". [370] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of  the  problem. [w] In  1974,  both  the  U.S.  and  British  governments  cut  off  exploratory  research  in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill [372] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more  productive  projects. [373] Minsky  and  Papert's  book Perceptrons was  understood  as  proving  that artificial  neural  networks  would  never  be  useful  for  solving  real-world  tasks,  thus  discrediting  the approach altogether. [374] The "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [9]

In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, [375] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. [8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longerlasting winter began. [10]

Up to  this  point,  most  of AI's  funding  had  gone  to  projects  that  used  high-level  symbols  to  represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics,  learning  and  pattern  recognition, [376] and  began  to  look  into  "sub-symbolic"  approaches. [377] Rodney Brooks rejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [x] Judea  Pearl,  Lotfi  Zadeh,  and  others  developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [87][382] But the most important  development  was  the  revival  of  "connectionism",  including  neural  network  research,  by Geoffrey  Hinton  and  others. [383] In  1990,  Yann  LeCun  successfully  showed  that  convolutional  neural networks  can  recognize handwritten digits, the first of many  successful  applications of neural networks. [384]

AI  gradually  restored  its  reputation  in  the  late  1990s  and  early  21st  century  by  exploiting  formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "narrow" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics  and  mathematics). [385] By  2000,  solutions  developed  by AI  researchers  were  being  widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence" (a tendency known as the  AI  effect). [386] However,  several  academic  researchers  became  concerned  that  AI  was  no  longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded  the  subfield  of  artificial  general  intelligence  (or  "AGI"),  which  had  several  well-funded institutions by the 2010s. [68]

Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. [11] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned. [y] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware  improvements  (faster  computers, [388] graphics  processing  units,  cloud  computing [389] )  and access to large amounts of data [390] (including curated datasets, [389] such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. [z] The  amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015-2019. [345]

In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many  researchers  re-focussed  their  careers  on  these  issues. The  alignment  problem  became  a  serious  field  of  academic study. [322]

In  the  late  2010s  and  early  2020s, AGI  companies  began  to deliver  programs  that  created  enormous  interest.  In  2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go  player.  The  program  taught  only  the  game's  rules  and developed  a  strategy  by  itself.  GPT-3  is  a  large  language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of

The number of Google searches for the term "AI" accelerated in 2022.

generating  high-quality  human-like  text. [391] ChatGPT,  launched  on  30  November  2022,  became  the fastest-growing  consumer  software  application  in  history,  gaining  over  100  million  users  in  two months. [392] It  marked  what  is  widely  regarded  as  AI's  breakout  year,  bringing  it  into  the  public consciousness. [393] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in "AI". [394] About 800,000 "AI"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [395] According  to  PitchBook  research,  22%  of  newly  funded  startups  in  2024  claimed  to  be AI companies. [396]

## Philosophy

Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent  machines. [397] Another  major  focus  has  been  whether  machines  can  be  conscious,  and  the associated  ethical  implications. [398] Many  other  topics  in  philosophy  are  relevant  to  AI,  such  as epistemology  and  free  will. [399] Rapid  advancements  have  intensified  public  discussions  on  the philosophy and ethics of AI. [398]

## Defining artificial intelligence

Alan Turing wrote in 1950 "I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?" [400] He  advised changing the question from whether a machine "thinks", to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour". [400] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [364] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is "actually" thinking or literally has a "mind". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but "it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks." [401]

Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [1] However,  they  are  critical  that  the  test  requires the  machine  to  imitate  humans.  "Aeronautical  engineering texts",  they  wrote,  "do  not  define  the  goal  of  their  field  as making  'machines  that  fly  so  exactly  like  pigeons  that  they can  fool  other  pigeons.' " [403] AI  founder  John  McCarthy agreed, writing that "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence". [404]

McCarthy defines intelligence  as  "the  computational  part  of the  ability  to  achieve  goals  in  the  world". [405] Another  AI founder, Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as "the ability to solve hard problems". [406] The leading AI textbook defines

The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [402]

<!-- image -->

it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [1] These  definitions  view  intelligence  in  terms  of  well-defined  problems  with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machine - and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.

Another definition has been adopted by Google, [407] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.

As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself [408] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. [409] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI'  is  often  used  too  broadly  and  vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms, [410] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did "not actually use AI in a material way". [411]

There  has  been  debate  over  whether  large  language  models  exhibit  genuine  intelligence  or  merely simulate it by imitating human text. [412]

## Evaluating approaches to AI

No  established  unifying  theory  or  paradigm  has  guided  AI  research  for  most  of  its  history. [aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so  that  some  sources,  especially  in  the  business  world,  use  the  term  "artificial  intelligence"  to  mean "machine learning with neural networks"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.

## Symbolic AI and its limits

Symbolic AI (or "GOFAI") [414] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis:  "A  physical  symbol  system  has  the  necessary  and  sufficient  means  of  general  intelligent action." [415]

However,  the  symbolic  approach  failed  on  many  tasks  that  humans  solve  easily,  such  as  learning, recognizing  an  object  or  commonsense  reasoning.  Moravec's  paradox  is  the  discovery  that  high-level "intelligent"  tasks  were  easy  for  AI,  but  low  level  "instinctive"  tasks  were  extremely  difficult. [416] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit  symbolic  knowledge. [417] Although  his  arguments  had  been  ridiculed  and  ignored  when  they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ab][16]

The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into  symbolic  AI  will  still  be  necessary  to  attain  general  intelligence, [419][420] in  part  because  subsymbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.

## Neat vs. scruffy

"Neats"  hope  that  intelligent  behavior  is  described  using  simple,  elegant  principles  (such  as  logic, optimization, or neural networks). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated  problems.  Neats  defend  their  programs  with  theoretical  rigor,  scruffies  rely  mainly  on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [421] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.

## Soft vs. hard computing

Finding  a  provably  correct  or  optimal  solution  is  intractable  for  many  important  problems. [15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.

## Narrow vs. general AI

AI  researchers  are  divided  as  to  whether  to  pursue  the  goals  of  artificial  general  intelligence  and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions  will  lead  indirectly  to  the  field's  long-term  goals. [422][423] General  intelligence  is  difficult  to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems  with  specific  solutions.  The  sub-field  of  artificial  general  intelligence  studies  this  area exclusively.

## Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind

There  is  no  settled  consensus  in  philosophy  of  mind  on  whether  a  machine  can  have  a  mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence.  Russell  and  Norvig  add  that  "[t]he  additional  project  of  making  a  machine  conscious  in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on." [424] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.

## Consciousness

David  Chalmers  identified  two  problems  in  understanding  the  mind,  which  he  named  the  "hard"  and "easy"  problems  of  consciousness. [425] The  easy  problem  is  understanding  how  the  brain  processes signals,  makes  plans  and  controls  behavior.  The  hard  problem  is  explaining  how  this feels or  why  it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like . [426]

## Computationalism and functionalism

Computationalism  is  the  position  in  the  philosophy  of  mind  that  the  human  mind  is  an  information processing  system  and  that  thinking  is  a  form  of  computing.  Computationalism  argues  that  the relationship  between  mind  and  body  is  similar  or  identical  to  the  relationship  between  software  and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind-body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by  the  work  of  AI  researchers  and  cognitive  scientists  in  the  1960s  and  was  originally  proposed  by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam. [427]

Philosopher  John  Searle  characterized  this  position  as  "strong  AI":  "The  appropriately  programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds." [ac] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [431]

## AI welfare and rights

It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [432] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then  it  may  be  entitled  to  certain  rights  or  welfare  protection  measures,  similarly  to  animals. [433][434] Sapience  (a  set  of  capacities  related  to  high  intelligence,  such  as  discernment  or  self-awareness)  may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [433] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [435]

In 2017, the European Union considered granting "electronic personhood" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would  have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [436] Critics  argued  in  2018  that  granting  rights  to  AI  systems  would  downplay  the importance  of  human  rights,  and  that  legislation  should  focus  on  user  needs  rather  than  speculative futuristic  scenarios.  They  also  noted  that  robots  lacked  the  autonomy  to  take  part  in  society  on  their own. [437][438]

Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. [434][433]

## Future

## Superintelligence and the singularity

A  superintelligence  is  a  hypothetical  agent  that  would  possess  intelligence  far  surpassing  that  of  the brightest  and  most  gifted  human  mind. [423] If  research  into  artificial  general  intelligence  produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an "intelligence explosion" and Vernor Vinge called a "singularity". [439]

However,  technologies  cannot  improve  exponentially  indefinitely,  and  typically  follow  an  S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. [440]

## Transhumanism

Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either.  This  idea,  called  transhumanism,  has  roots  in  the  writings  of  Aldous  Huxley  and  Robert Ettinger. [441]

Edward Fredkin argues that "artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution", an idea first proposed by Samuel  Butler's  "Darwin  among  the  Machines"  as  far  back  as  1863,  and  expanded  upon  by  George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . [442]

## In fiction

Thought-capable  artificial  beings  have  appeared  as storytelling devices since antiquity, [443] and  have been a persistent theme in science fiction. [444]

A  common  trope  in  these  works  began  with  Mary Shelley's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes  a  threat  to  its  masters.  This  includes  such works  as  Arthur  C.  Clarke's  and  Stanley  Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the  murderous  computer  in  charge  of  the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999).  In  contrast,  the  rare  loyal  robots such  as  Gort  from The  Day  the  Earth  Stood  Still

The word "robot" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R. , the title standing for "Rossum's Universal Robots".

(1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [445]

Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the "Multivac" super-intelligent  computer.  Asimov's  laws  are  often  brought  up  during  lay  discussions  of  machine ethics; [446] while  almost  all  artificial  intelligence  researchers  are  familiar  with Asimov's  laws  through popular  culture,  they  generally  consider  the  laws  useless  for  many  reasons,  one  of  which  is  their ambiguity. [447]

Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek's R.U.R. , the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina , as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? , by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence. [448]

- b. This list of tools is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell &amp; Norvig (2021), Luger &amp; Stubblefield (2004), Poole, Mackworth &amp; Goebel (1998) and Nilsson (1998)
- c. It is among the reasons that expert systems proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge. [30][31]
- d. "Rational agent" is general term used in economics, philosophy and theoretical artificial intelligence. It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a person, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or in the case of AI, a computer program.
- e. Alan Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence". [42] In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, Ray Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: "An Inductive Inference Machine". [43]
- f. See AI winter § Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966.
- g. Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be conditionally independent of one another. AdSense uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve. [94]
- h. Expectation-maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown latent variables. [96]
- i. Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described by: Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) [117]  Alan Turing (1948); [118]  Karl Steinbuch and Roger David Joseph (1961). [119]  Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used gradient descent) were developed by: Frank Rosenblatt(1957); [118] Oliver Selfridge (1959); [119]  Alexey Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa (1965); [120]  Kaoru Nakano (1971); [121] Shun-Ichi Amari (1972); [121]  John Joseph Hopfield (1982). [121]  Precursors to backpropagation were developed by: Henry J. Kelley (1960); [118] Arthur E. Bryson (1962); [118]  Stuart Dreyfus (1962); [118]  Arthur E. Bryson and Yu-Chi Ho (1969); [118] Backpropagation was independently developed by: Seppo Linnainmaa (1970); [122]  Paul Werbos (1974). [118]
- j. Geoffrey Hinton said, of his work on neural networks in the 1990s, "our labeled datasets were thousands of times too small. [And] our computers were millions of times too slow." [123]
- k. In statistics, a bias is a systematic error or deviation from the correct value. But in the context of fairness, it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful. A statistically unbiased AI system that produces disparate outcomes for different demographic groups may thus be viewed as biased in the ethical sense. [252]
- l. Including Jon Kleinberg (Cornell University), Sendhil Mullainathan (University of Chicago), Cynthia Chouldechova (Carnegie Mellon) and Sam Corbett-Davis (Stanford) [262]
- m. Moritz Hardt (a director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems) argues that machine learning "is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you're trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world." [267]
- n. When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision.
- o. This is the United Nations' definition, and includes things like land mines as well. [283]
- p. See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the U.S. average. [294]
- q. Sometimes called a "robopocalypse" [303]
- r. "Electronic brain" was the term used by the press around this time. [360][362]
- s. Daniel Crevier wrote, "the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science." [365] Russell and Norvig called the conference "the inception of artificial intelligence." [117]
- t. Russell and Norvig wrote "for the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these people and their students." [366]
- u. Russell and Norvig wrote, "it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish". [367]
- v. The programs described are Arthur Samuel's checkers program for the IBM 701, Daniel Bobrow's STUDENT, Newell and Simon's Logic Theorist and Terry Winograd's SHRDLU.
- w. Russell and Norvig write: "in almost all cases, these early systems failed on more difficult problems" [371]
- x. Embodied approaches to AI [378]  were championed by Hans Moravec [379]  and Rodney Brooks [380] and went by many names: Nouvelle AI. [380] Developmental robotics. [381]
- y. Matteo Wong wrote in The Atlantic : "Whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called "deep learning". As a result, their code and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate into one another." [387]
- z. Jack Clark wrote in Bloomberg: "After a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. Computers are smarter and learning faster than ever", and noted that the number of software projects that use machine learning at Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015. [389]
27. aa. Nils Nilsson wrote in 1983: "Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about." [413]
28. ab. Daniel Crevier wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier." [418]
29. ac. Searle presented this definition of "Strong AI" in 1999. [428]  Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states." [429] Strong AI is defined similarly by Russell and Norvig: "Stong AI - the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking)." [430]
