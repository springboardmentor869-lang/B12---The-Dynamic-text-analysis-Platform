Task 1: PDF Parser Evaluation & Selection

Objective: Comparative analysis of PDF parsing libraries to select the most efficient tool for the NarrativeNexus input pipeline.

Methodology: We evaluated PyMuPDF (fitz), pdfplumber, and pypdf using the Word Error Rate (WER) metric on three distinct document types:

Complex: Project Roadmap (Headers, Lists, Formatting)

Simple: Plain text control sample

Article: Wikipedia article (Double-column/Standard text)

Results Summary:
|Library   |Complex Doc (WER) |Article Doc (WER)|Article Speed (s) |
| :---      | :---           | :---            | :---             | 
| PyMuPDF   | 0.0373 (3.7%)  | 0.0000 (0%)     | 0.0174s          | 
| pypdf     | 0.0256 (2.5%)  | 0.0000 (0%)     | 0.1396s          | 
| pdfplumber| 0.5221 (52.2%) | 0.0048 (0.4%)   | 1.1487s          |

Key Findings:

pdfplumber failed significantly on complex formatting (52% error) and was the slowest tool.

pypdf performed best on complex formatting but was significantly slower (~8x slower) than PyMuPDF on standard articles.

PyMuPDF demonstrated perfect accuracy (0%) on standard text and articles while delivering the fastest processing times.

Conclusion: PyMuPDF is selected as the production parser. While pypdf had a marginal accuracy advantage on complex layouts, PyMuPDF's superior processing speed and perfect accuracy on standard articles make it the optimal choice for scaling the platform to process "large amounts of text data" as required by the roadmap.
