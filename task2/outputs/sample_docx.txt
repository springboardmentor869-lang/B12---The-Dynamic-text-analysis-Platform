The Power of Dreams
 Riya was a quiet girl living in a small village surrounded by green fields and narrow roads. She loved reading books and dreamed of becoming an engineer one day. Many people around her felt that big dreams were not meant for people from small places, but Riya believed otherwise. Every morning, she helped her family before going to college. After returning home, she studied late into the night under a small lamp. There were days when she felt tired and hopeless, but her dream kept her moving forward. Her teachers noticed her dedication and encouraged her to work harder. They guided her whenever she felt confused and motivated her to believe in herself.
