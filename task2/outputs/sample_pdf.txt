The Power of Dreams
Riya was a quiet girl living in a small village surrounded by green fields
and narrow roads. She loved reading books and dreamed of becoming
an engineer one day. Many people around her felt that big dreams
were not meant for people from small places, but Riya believed
otherwise.
Every morning, she helped her family before going to college. After
returning home, she studied late into the night under a small lamp.
There were days when she felt tired and hopeless, but her dream kept
her moving forward.
Her teachers noticed her dedication and encouraged her to work
harder. They guided her whenever she felt confused and motivated her
to believe in herself.With time, Riya’s efforts began to show results. She performed well in
her exams and secured admission to a reputed engineering college.
The journey was not easy, but she faced every challenge with courage.
Years later, Riya achieved her dream and became a successful
engineer. She did not forget her roots. She returned to her village and
spoke to students about the importance of education and self-belief.
Her story became a source of inspiration for many young minds. Riya
proved that determination, hard work, and confidence can turn even
the smallest dreams into reality.
