## Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.

Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.

This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Form 10-K.

## Macroeconomic and Industry Risks

## The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales. In addition, the Company's global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company's supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.

Adverse  macroeconomic  conditions,  including  slow  growth  or  recession,  high  unemployment,  inflation,  tighter  credit,  higher  interest  rates,  and  currency fluctuations,  can  adversely  impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company's products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.

In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company's products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company's suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.

Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company's trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company's ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company's financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

## The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.

Political  events,  trade  and  other  international  disputes,  war,  terrorism,  natural  disasters,  public  health  issues,  industrial  accidents  and  other  business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.

The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company's operations and supply chain and limit the Company's ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the  Company's  operations  in  accordance  with  new  or  changed  restrictions  on  international  trade  can  be  expensive,  time-consuming  and  disruptive  to  the Company's operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company's business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more  severe  and  restrictive  and  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's  business.  Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other  international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company's business.

Many of the Company's operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that  are  prone  to  earthquakes  and  other  natural  disasters.  In  addition,  such  operations  and  facilities  are  subject  to  the  risk  of  interruption  by  fire,  power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company's control. Global climate change is resulting  in  certain  types  of  natural  disasters,  such  as  droughts,  floods,  hurricanes  and  wildfires,  occurring  more  frequently  or  with  more  intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.

The Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the  Company's  business,  and  harm  to  the  Company's  reputation.  Major  public  health  issues,  including  pandemics  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  have adversely affected,  and  could  in  the  future  materially  adversely  affect,  the  Company  due  to  their  impact  on  the  global  economy  and  demand  for  consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.

## Global markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.

The Company's products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.

The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies  to  the  marketplace. The  Company  designs  and  develops  nearly  the  entire  solution  for  its  products,  including  the  hardware,  operating  system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&amp;D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.

The  Company  currently  holds  a  significant  number  of  patents,  trademarks  and  copyrights  and  has  registered,  and  applied  to  register,  additional  patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country  in  which  the  Company  operates.  If  the  Company  is  unable  to  continue  to  develop  and  sell  innovative  new  products  with  attractive  margins  or  if competitors infringe on the Company's intellectual property, the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.

The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company's competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.

Additionally,  the  Company  faces  significant  competition  as  competitors  imitate  the  Company's  product  features  and  applications  within  their  products  or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company's approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.

The Company's services also face substantial  competition,  including  from  companies  that  have  significant  resources  and  experience  and  have  established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.

The Company's business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company's ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.

## Business Risks

## To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.

Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products,  services  and  technologies,  enhance  existing  products  and  services,  effectively  stimulate  customer  demand  for  new  and  upgraded  products  and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company's products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.

## The  Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners,  many  of  which  are located outside of the U.S.

Substantially all of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company's supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality  or  quantity  of  products  manufactured  or  services  provided,  or  adversely  affect  the  Company's  flexibility  to  respond  to  changing  conditions. Although arrangements  with  these  partners  may  contain  provisions  for  product  defect  expense  reimbursement,  the  Company  generally  remains  responsible  to  the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company's hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company's cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.

The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.

## Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.

Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components,  including  those  that  are  available  from  multiple  sources,  are  at  times  subject  to  industry-wide  shortages  and  significant  commodity  pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components  and  products  on  commercially  reasonable  terms  or  at  all.  Such  disruptions  could  occur  in  the  future.  While  the  Company  has  entered  into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at  all.  Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company's suppliers, described in ' The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, ' above, can also affect the Company's ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity  constraints  may  exist  until  the  suppliers'  yields  have  matured  or  their  manufacturing  capacities  have  increased. The  continued  availability  of  these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. When the Company's supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's business, results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  have  been  adversely  affected  and  future  delays  or  constraints  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company's business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition.  The  Company's  business  and  financial  performance  could  also  be  materially  adversely  affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.

## The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.

The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could  make  the  Company's  products  unsafe  and  create  a  risk  of  environmental  or  property  damage  and  personal  injury.  These  risks  may  increase  as  the Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company's services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company's products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.

## The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.

The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.

The  Company  orders  components  for  its  products  and  builds  inventory  in  advance  of  product  announcements  and  shipments.  Manufacturing  purchase obligations cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company's markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.

## The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

The Company's products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company's products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

## The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.

The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.  There  can  be  no  assurance  third-party  developers  will  continue  to  develop  and  maintain  software  applications  and  services  for  the  Company's products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products.

The  Company believes  the  availability  of  third-party  software  applications  and  services  for  its  products  depends  in  part  on  the  developers'  perception  and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.

The Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.

The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company's products.

The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they  generate  on  the App  Store.  The  Company  retains  a  commission  from  sales  of  applications  and  sales  of  digital  services  or  goods  initiated  within  an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union ('EU') Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company's business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

## Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.

The  Company  also  produces  its  own  digital  content,  which  can  be  costly  to  produce  due  to  intense  and  increasing  competition  for  talent,  content  and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.

Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.

## The Company's success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company's ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.

Much of the Company's future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and  competition  for  their  talents  is  intense,  especially  in  Silicon  Valley,  where  most  of  the  Company's  key  personnel  are  located.  In  addition  to  intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company's culture, reputation and operational flexibility.

The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

## The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.

The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.

Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company's products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users' purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.

The  Company  has  invested  and  will  continue  to  invest  in  programs  to  enhance  reseller  sales,  including  staffing  selected  resellers'  stores  with  Company employees  and  contractors,  and  improving  product  placement  displays.  These  programs  can  require  a  substantial  investment  while  not  assuring  return  or incremental  sales.  The  financial  condition  of  these  resellers  could  weaken,  these  resellers  could  stop  distributing  the  Company's  products,  or  uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company's products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.

## The Company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.

The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or  network  disruptions  caused  by  natural  disasters,  accidents,  power  disruptions,  telecommunications  failures,  acts  of  terrorism  or  war,  computer  viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company's or its vendors' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company's business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company's online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company's products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

## Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.

The Company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company's customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company's business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also  exposed  to  ransomware  and  other  malicious  attacks  that  can  disrupt  business  operations. Although  the  Company  takes  steps  to  secure  confidential information  that  is  provided  to  or  accessible  by  third  parties  working  on  the  Company's  behalf,  such  measures  are  not  always  effective  and  losses  or unauthorized  access  to,  or  releases  of,  confidential  information  occur.  Such  incidents  and  other  malicious  attacks  could  materially  adversely  affect  the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The  Company  experiences  malicious  attacks  and  other  attempts  to  gain  unauthorized  access  to  its  systems  on  a  regular  basis.  These  attacks  seek  to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company's ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company's stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls,  avoid  detection,  and  remove  or  obfuscate  forensic  evidence,  all  of  which  hinders  the  Company's  ability  to  identify,  investigate  and  recover  from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.

Although  malicious  attacks  perpetrated  to  gain  access  to  confidential  information,  including  personal  information,  affect  many  companies  across  various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.

The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error,  faulty  password  management  or  other  irregularities.  For  example,  third  parties  can  fraudulently  induce  the  Company's  or  its  vendors'  employees  or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company's or its vendors'  systems  and  services.  To  help  protect  customers  and  the  Company,  the  Company  deploys  and  makes  available  technologies  like  multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company's products and services.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
